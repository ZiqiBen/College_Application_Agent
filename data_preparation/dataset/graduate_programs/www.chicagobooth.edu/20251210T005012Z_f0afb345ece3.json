Here are just a few of the options. Accounting for Entrepreneurship: From Start-Up through IPO This course develops and illustrates a set of tools needed to provide accounting and related functions for private, entrepreneurial firms. The class will follow the life-cycle of a business that originates as a startup and will cover the accounting-related financial metrics and tools that are needed by an entrepreneur. Financial Accounting This course provides an introduction to financial statements and the financial reporting process from a user's perspective. The course focuses on fundamental accounting concepts and principles, and students will learn how the economic transactions of a firm are reported in the financial statements and related disclosures. Cost Analysis and Internal Controls This course provides you with a framework to understand and use the cost and accounting information you will encounter in careers in consulting, operations, marketing, or general management. The course covers the vocabulary and mechanics of cost accounting, basic issues involved in the design of managerial accounting systems, and the role of managerial accounting for resource allocation and performance evaluation. Accounting and Financial Analysis This course looks at the firm's accounting policy for a particular type of transaction and determines how that policy choice affects its primary financial statements. You will learn how to question whether these effects fairly reflect the underlying economics of the firm's transactions using the lenses of accounting, economics, finance, and strategy. The goal is to improve your ability to use accounting numbers to assess the firm's strategy and the potential rewards and risks of dealing with the firm. Taxes and Business Strategy Investment bankers, financial executives, and consultants who want to have a competitive advantage by understanding how taxes impact the structure and value of deals, as well as managers and analysts who need to understand how firms strategically respond to tax incentives, will find this course useful. You will learn to integrate concepts from finance, economics, and accounting to achieve a more complete understanding of the role of taxes in business strategy.

You will learn to integrate concepts from finance, economics, and accounting to achieve a more complete understanding of the role of taxes in business strategy. Financial Statement Analysis Explore a financial analysis framework that provides links among a firm's business, its financial statements and associated disclosures for the purpose of forecasting and corporate valuation. The perspective taken is that of an external stakeholder relying on publicly available information for decision-making purposes. The course provides the tools necessary to analyze financial statements and perform corporate valuation. It is applied in nature and stresses the use of actual financial statements. Advanced Financial Analysis and Valuation for Global Firms The course is designed for students who already have a basic familiarity with corporate valuation and DCF analysis as well as solid accounting knowledge. We cover financial analysis of different business models, specific situations (e.g., cyclicals, young growth companies, closely held firms), as well as the analysis and valuation of foreign companies (e.g., emerging markets, reporting under IFRS). Capital markets have become increasingly global, but evaluating global investments and M&A poses unique challenges for financial analysis.

Choose Your Courses Customize your education by choosing courses that match your specific interests. To complete a concentration in Analytic Finance, you’ll choose six courses in the discipline, including two advanced courses. Here are just a few of the options. Portfolio Management This quantitative course presents advanced material relevant for portfolio managers, extending the material covered in Investments. Topics include the money management industry (mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds), modern techniques for optimal portfolio selection, liquidity and transaction costs, properties of asset returns, and investment strategies designed to exploit apparent violations of market efficiency. Quantitative Portfolio Management There has been a proliferation of new products and investment strategies in the asset management space in recent years. This course applies portfolio theory to understand and evaluate these products and strategies in the context of the empirical evidence about return patterns across assets (i.e., the factors such as value/growth, momentum, low volatility, and carry that drive returns) in multiple markets/asset classes (e.g., US and international equities and bonds, currencies, and commodities). Fixed-Income Asset Pricing This course covers state-of-the art models and techniques required to analyze fixed-income instruments, and their derivatives, in modern financial markets. By the end of the course, students will learn 1) the basic concepts of fixed-income instruments, such as yield, duration, and convexity; 2) the modern empirical methodologies to describe Treasury and corporate bond data, such as “curve fitting,” factor analysis, and default probabilities; 3) the most recent modeling techniques for fixed-income derivative products used in the street, such as the models of Vasicek, Cox Ingersoll, and Ross; Ho and Lee; Hull",

The key feature of Fixed-Income Asset Pricing is that it strongly emphasizes the applications of these models to value real-world fixed-income products, and their derivatives, by focusing both on the practical difficulties of applying models to the data, as well as on the necessity to use computers to compute prices. Cases in Financial Risk Management Financial risk management is reported to be the main reason for the use of financial derivatives by nonfinancial institutions. This course has two main objectives. The first is to cover techniques to identify, measure, and manage corporate financial risk, as modern financial markets and regulation require. Specifically, topics of discussion will include dynamic hedging and portfolio replication, the development of value-at-risk, and the management of exchange-rate risk, interest-rate risk, credit risk, and operation risk. The second main objective is to build a framework to integrate financial risk–management solutions with long-term corporate strategy. We will discuss cases where the use of financial engineering was vital for the success of a business strategy. Typical applications in this case include privatizations, mergers and acquisitions, and financing strategies, among others. However, the course will focus more on the uses of derivative securities rather than their technical aspects. To see all courses offered at Booth, visit our course catalog.

This course teaches you how to make decisions in both types of situations. With respect to the first type of situation, students will learn analytical tools and how to use them to reach optimal solutions. With respect to the second type of situation, students will discover errors “normal people” often commit when they make decisions intuitively, and how to overcome these errors and thereby become “less normal”—namely, smarter than the average person. Many topics covered are based on Nobel Prize–winning research on behavioral decision theory; it is the foundation of behavioral economics, behavioral marketing, and behavioral finance. Strategies and Processes of Negotiation Managerial success requires agreement and collaboration with other people. This course is designed to be relevant to the broad spectrum of negotiation problems that are faced by managers, and to teach you the skills necessary to discover and implement optimal solutions to these problems. These skills include an understanding of the problem at hand, the other parties involved, the common biases in the judgments and decisions of negotiators, and the effective tactics of social influence. Managing in Organizations Business undertakings, both those that are successful and those that fall short, commonly play out through people acting together. Understanding the factors that determine people's actions and interactions is therefore a critical prerequisite for being effective in the work environment. This course is about managing people—oneself and others. Designing a Good Life This is primarily a course about ethics, but it is far from a typical ethics course. Students will not spend time discussing ethical dilemmas, or trying to decide what is right or wrong in ethical settings. Instead, students will adopt a psychological approach to understanding ethical behavior. Students will try to provide some answers to the most fundamental problem in all of ethics: Why do good people sometimes do bad things? To see all courses offered at Booth, visit our course catalog.
