In addition, you will become involved in co-curricular and extracurricular activities that tie into the courses you choose.\nSummer\nMBA summer internships teach real-world skills, advance your education through experience, and allow you to test your new skills from your first year of the MBA program. Even if the summer internship does not lead to a full-time offer, it is a great opportunity to improve your resume and network with new people.\nInternships are not required, but most students choose one or more internships, often in combination with other summer experiences. Some students choose to work on their startup over the summer instead of interning at a company.\nLearn more about\nWharton MBA internship statistics\n.\nYear Two\nYou will take any remaining core requirements, drill deeper within the wide range of electives, and develop one or more areas of expertise.
