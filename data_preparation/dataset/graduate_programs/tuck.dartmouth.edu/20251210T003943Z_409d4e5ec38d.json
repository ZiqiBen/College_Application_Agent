How will the distinct Tuck MBA contribute to achieving your goals and aspirations? What particular aspects of Tuck will be instrumental in your growth? (2000 characters)\nTell us who you are. How have your values and experiences shaped your identity and character? How will your unique background contribute to Tuck and/or enhance the experience of your classmates? (2000 characters)\nDescribe a time when you meaningfully invested in someone else’s success without immediate benefit to yourself. What motivated you, and what was the impact? (2000 characters)\n“You can find advice and essay guidance from many outside influencers and websites; however, my colleagues and I want you to hear directly from those of us who are reading and evaluating your essays.”\n—Patricia Harrison, Director of Admissions, Evaluation and Yield\nDive into advice for each essay prompt:\nTuck Admissions Insights: 2025-2026 Application Essays\nAll reapplicants must respond to an additional essay prompt:\nHow have you strengthened your candidacy since you last applied? Reflect on how you have grown personally and professionally and how your understanding of Tuck has developed. (2000 characters)\nThe following essay prompt is optional:\nPlease provide any additional insight or information that you have not addressed elsewhere (e.g., atypical choice of references, factors affecting academic performance, unexplained job gaps or changes). Complete this question only if you feel your candidacy is not fully represented by this application. (2000 characters)\n“Rest assured; this is not a test. We will not think less of you if you do not submit an extra essay here. Most of you will likely not need to use this section at all, and for those of you who do—own your past.”\n—Patricia Harrison, Director of Admissions, Evaluation and Yield\nReview guidance on how this section is best used and when to refrain from using it altogether:\nTuck Admissions Insights: Optional Information Section\nThe best responses to essay prompts are clear, succinct, forthright, thoughtful, genuine, and so distinctly personal that only you could have written them. We expect that your essays are entirely accurate and exclusively yours. Using tools or professional services to create content that is not your own violates Tuck’s admissions policies and Academic Honor Principle.\nLetters of Reference (LORs)\nYou must submit two LORs unless you are a reapplicant who applied during the most recent admissions cycle. Reapplicants who applied during the most recent admissions cycle need to submit only one new LOR from a reference who did not write to Tuck on your behalf last year.\nDetails\nIn the application, you will be asked to enter your reference’s information. We will email each reference a unique link to our LOR form. All LORs must be submitted virtually by your reference(s) via this process.\nReferences who cannot write in English should write in their native language and have the LOR translated by an outside translation service. Do not translate the LOR into English for your reference.\nYour reference must be the sole author of your LOR. Drafting, writing, translating, or submitting your own LOR, even if asked to do so by your reference, violates Tuck’s admissions policies and Academic Honor Principle. You are responsible for informing your references of this policy.\nYou are also responsible for notifying your references of your application deadline and ensuring your LORs are submitted on time. We review your application only if all required LORs are received by your application deadline. Otherwise, we will move your application to the next admission round. If your application is not complete by the final deadline it will be evaluated as is. If you would like to make changes to your list of references, please\ncontact us\n.\nWhat We Ask\nTuck uses the Recommendation Questions posed by GMAC’s Common Letter of Recommendation.\nPlease provide a brief description of your interaction with the applicant and, if applicable, the applicant’s role in your organization. (50 words)\nHow does the applicant's performance compare to that of other well-qualified individuals in similar roles? Provide specific examples. (500 words)\nDescribe the most important piece of constructive feedback you have given the applicant. Please detail the circumstances and the applicant’s response. (500 words)\nOptional: Is there anything else we should know?\nSelecting Your References\nRequest LORs from people who can demonstrate that you are smart, accomplished, aware, and encouraging.\nIf possible, your current direct supervisor should write one of your LORs. You will be asked to provide a brief explanation in the Other Employment Information section of your application if you are not providing an LOR from a direct supervisor. If more than a brief explanation of recommender choice is needed, you may further clarify your choice with a few sentences in the Optional Information section of the application.\nLORs from professors who did not supervise professional work, from friends, family members, or coaches, do not enhance your candidacy and are discouraged.\n“Once you have identified who you would like to write for you, ask them these three questions: 1) Do you have sufficient knowledge of my performance and outcomes to write a compelling LOR? 2) Do you have the desire to write a positive LOR? and 3) Do you have the time to write a detailed LOR? If the answer to any of these questions is “no,” find someone else.”\n—Patricia Harrison, Director of Admissions, Evaluation and Yield\nExplore additional suggestions for selecting and preparing your references:\nTuck Admissions Insights: Letters of Reference\nApplication Fee and Waivers\nA non-refundable application fee of $250 USD is due upon application submission.

We expect that your essays are entirely accurate and exclusively yours.

If more than a brief explanation of recommender choice is needed, you may further clarify your choice with a few sentences in the Optional Information section of the application. LORs from professors who did not supervise professional work, from friends, family members, or coaches, do not enhance your candidacy and are discouraged. “Once you have identified who you would like to write for you, ask them these three questions: 1) Do you have sufficient knowledge of my performance and outcomes to write a compelling LOR? 2) Do you have the desire to write a positive LOR? and 3) Do you have the time to write a detailed LOR? If the answer to any of these questions is “no,” find someone else.” —Patricia Harrison, Director of Admissions, Evaluation and Yield Explore additional suggestions for selecting and preparing your references: Tuck Admissions Insights: Letters of Reference Application Fee and Waivers A non-refundable application fee of $250 USD is due upon application submission.
