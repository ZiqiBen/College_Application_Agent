  "raw_text": "Curriculum\nThere are moments that pull everything we’ve learned into focus. When theory, practice, experience, and talent all come to one sharp point — a decision that shapes a definitive path.\nHarvard Business School’s MBA curriculum includes a range of exciting courses and is frequently refreshed with new content. The goal is to give students a firm grasp of broad-based fundamentals. The School’s inductive learning model goes beyond facts and theories—a process that teaches individuals not only how to manage organizations, but also how to continually grow and learn throughout life.\nRequired Curriculum (First Year)\nDuring the first year at Harvard Business School (HBS), all students pursue the same course of study: the Required Curriculum and FIELD. By studying under a common curriculum, students build a solid, broad foundation of general management concepts and skills across all the key disciplines.\nFall Term\nFinance 1\nFinancial Reporting & Control\n(FRC)\nLeadership & Organizational Behavior\n(LEAD)\nMarketing\nTechnology & Operations Management\n(TOM)\nStrategy\nSpring Term\nData Science & AI for Leaders\nBusiness, Government & the International Economy\n(BGIE)\nThe Entrepreneurial Manager\n(TEM)\nFinance II\nLeadership & Corporate Accountability\n(LCA)\nFIELD Global Capstone\nThe Purpose of the Firm\nThe Summer Work Experience\nStudents fulfill the requirement through successful completion of a summer work experience—either with an established organization or by launching an entrepreneurial venture, and in either a paid or an unpaid position. Any student facing personal circumstances that do not allow for an internship could apply for a waiver.\nElective Curriculum (Second Year)\nThe Elective Curriculum (EC) follows the RC's breadth of experience with an opportunity for depth, breadth, or both: students choose from among over 100 courses in ten subject areas as well as field-based learning opportunities—including immersion experiences—to gain a more concentrated expertise in the industries, functions, and ideas that interest them most. Additionally, cross registration enables students to take classes at other select graduate programs during their EC year.\nStudents may take any combination of courses—up to five courses per semester—and also have the opportunity to cross-register for courses in other select graduate programs.\nCourse Descriptions\nLearning Methods\nPlay\nVideo duration:\n9:59\nTake a Seat in the MBA Classroom.\nHave you ever wondered what it was like to experience Harvard Business School’s Case Method teaching style?
