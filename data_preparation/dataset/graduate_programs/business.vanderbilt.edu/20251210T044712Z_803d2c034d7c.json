Exempt from this policy are master's degrees that focus on a specific functional area of business (such as accounting, finance, or management information systems) and do not offer a broad general management curriculum typical of the MBA degree.\nQ.\nDoes the Vanderbilt MBA program require any quantitative courses as prerequisites?\nA.\nThere are no specific prerequisites for our program. Before classes start, Vanderbilt offers a Quant Camp review program for incoming MBA students. Candidates with little or no business background are urged to review statistics, basic finance, accounting, and/or economic principles before the program in order to be adequately prepared for the quantitative rigor of the program.\nClick here\nfor a detailed explanation of our admissions criteria.\nQ.\nDoes the Vanderbilt MBA program accept transfer students or transfer credits?\nA.\nNo. We are unable to accept transfer students or transfer credits. If we do admit an individual who is already enrolled in another full-time MBA program, transfer credits will not be accepted and the student will be expected to complete all 62 credits required for the Vanderbilt MBA degree.\nQ.\nDoes the Vanderbilt MBA program accept a 3-year undergraduate degree?\nA.\nApplicants must have obtained a four-year U.S. Bachelor’s degree from an accredited university or college, or its equivalent, and you can view our\ninternational education requirements here\n. We strongly recommend candidates with a 3-year degree obtain and submit a WES or IEE course-by-course evaluation showing degree equivalency. In some cases, a course-by-course evaluation showing degree equivalency will be required for application evaluation.\nQ.\nWhat kind of work experience does the Admissions Committee consider?\nA.\nWe consider all full-time work, including military experience and volunteer work. Most students in our program have at least 2 years of work experience, with the majority of students having an average of 4-6 years of full-time post-baccalaureate experience.\nEvents & Visits\nQ.\nCan I conduct an on campus visit?\nA.\nCampus Visits are offered on select Mondays and Thursdays while classes are in session.

Modular System The Vanderbilt MBA academic calendar is based on a modular system of intensive courses, each seven weeks in length plus an exam week. Two \"mods\" equal one semester. Mods give you a fast start by allowing you to take courses in your chosen specialty as early as Mod 2 of your first year. You can complete significant study in your field of interest before taking on a summer internship. The total number of courses over a two-year period allows you the freedom and flexibility to take electives within your chosen specialty or branch out by taking courses in cross-functional areas of interest within Vanderbilt Owen Graduate School of Management or other schools at Vanderbilt. Year One As a candidate for a Vanderbilt MBA, you will study on campus for two years for a minimum of 62 credit hours. During your first year, you will receive an intense and immediate immersion in the fundamentals of management through 11 required core courses. The majority of core courses are taken during the first two mods. Year Two During your second year, you will take a required ethics class while customizing your electives to your desired career goals. Each student will complete at least one Concentration, which consists of 12 credit hours in a single discipline beyond the Core. Students are then free to take a wide variety of elective courses that best match their career aspirations. Further Customize Your Curriculum Students interested in a \"deeper dive\" into a discipline may choose to pursue a Specialization of 20 credit hours. Emphases allow students to augment their course of study with 8 credit hours in one of three areas. *Degree requirements and course information are subject to change; not all courses are offered every year.
