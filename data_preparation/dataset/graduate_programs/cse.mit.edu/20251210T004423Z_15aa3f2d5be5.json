Additional information, including any future plans to restart external admissions, will be posted here if/when they become available.\nAre You a Current MIT Grad Student Interested in CSE?\nCurrent MIT graduate students enrolled in a research-based master’s and/or doctoral degree program may be eligible to apply for the CSE SM as a secondary degree.\nMore Info for Current MIT Grad Students\nProgram Overview\nThe master’s degree in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), previously the Computation for Design and Optimization (CDO) SM program, is an interdisciplinary program designed to prepare tomorrow’s engineers and scientists in advanced computational methods and applications. The program provides a strong foundation in computational approaches to the design and operation of complex engineered and scientific systems.\nAs an interdisciplinary academic program, the CSE SM is housed in the Center for Computational Science & Engineering but students have the opportunity to work with faculty from across the Institute.  Through hands-on projects and a master’s thesis, students develop and apply advanced computational methods to a diverse range of applications, from aerospace to nanotechnology, from Internet protocols to telecommunications system design. Career opportunities for CSE SM graduates include companies and research centers where systems modeling, numerical simulation, design and optimization play a critical role.\nProgram Curriculum\n1\nCSE SM Catalog Listing\nThe CSE SM program is designed with a common core that serves all engineering disciplines, and an elective component that focuses on particular applications. Students must complete coursework distributed as described below (F = course offered in Fall semester; S = course offered in Spring semester).\nCore Subjects\n(3 course / 36 units)\nStudents are required to take three of four core subjects designed to provide foundation materials needed for the study of more advanced elective topics. The core subjects are chosen from the following:\n6.7310[J] / 18.335[J]\nIntroduction to Numerical Methods (S)\n2.096[J] / 6.7300[J] / 16.910[J]\nIntroduction to Numerical Simulation (F)\n2.097[J] / 6.7330[J] / 16.920[J]\nNumerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations (F)\n6.C57[J] / 15.C57[J] / IDS.C57 [J]\n(formerly 6.7200[J] / 15.093[J])\nOptimization Methods (F)\nRestricted Electives\n(2 courses / 24 units)\nStudents choose two graduate-level electives from a list of over 50 specialized subjects that have computational themes and related components, and that are aligned with the program’s educational mission. The current list of approved restricted elective (RE) subjects can be found\nin the CSE SM Catalog Listing\n.\nUnrestricted Elective\n(1 course / 12 units)\nStudents may choose any\ngraduate-level\n12-unit subject from the\nMIT Subject Listing and Schedule\n.\nThesis\n(36 units)\nStudents write a master’s thesis under the supervision of a faculty advisor.\n*Courses that can be repeated for credit cannot be used to satisfy multiple CSE SM requirements.\nSubjects taken with the graduate P/D/F grading option cannot be used to satisfy CSE SM curricular requirements.\n↩︎\nOther Program Details\nAcademic Performance Policy\nCSE SM students are expected to maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 4.5 (out of 5) during the course of their studies.\nIf a student’s term GPA is at or below 4.0 for two sequential terms, if a student receives an Unsatisfactory (“U”) grade in CSE.THG, or if a grade of C or lower is given in any subject, a warning from the CCSE co-directors will be issued to the student, and the MIT Graduate Academic Performance Group will be alerted.\nPlease see the\nOffice of the Dean for Graduate Education’s Academic Performance page\nfor more information.\nEnglish Language Proficiency\nAll CSE SM students are required to take the\nGraduate Writing Exam\nrun by the MIT Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies.  Students who do not receive a passing score are required to take\n21W.794 Graduate Technical Writing Workshop\n.  Students may choose to take the workshop with P/D/F grading (rather than an A – F letter grade), however they must receive a P grade.\nProgram Timing\nThe CSE SM program is designed so that students who are either self-supported or on fellowship can complete the program in 12-18 months.
