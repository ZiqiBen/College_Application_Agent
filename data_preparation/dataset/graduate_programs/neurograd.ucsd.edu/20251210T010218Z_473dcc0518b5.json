Though, we gladly welcome applicants from diverse fields of study. Although there are no strict course requirements for admission, a suggested undergraduate preparation includes at least one year each of general biology, calculus and physics, two years of chemistry (general, physical, or organic), as well as advanced course work in other areas of science, such as biophysics, biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, molecular biology, neurobiology, microbiology, and immunology.\nApplication Deadline: November 24, 2025 at 11:59 PM (Local Time Zone).\nApplication Opens: September 3, 2025\nAll application materials must be received by the deadline. Incomplete applications will not be considered.\nBefore beginning your application, please review our FAQs as well as the information on the\nUC San Diego Graduate Admissions Website\nHow to Apply\n1)\nUC San Diego Graduate Application\nCreate an account at gradapply.ucsd.edu\nComplete all requested information of the online application\nSelect: Neuroscience (NE75) as the program of study\nMake sure to complete our department questions\nPrevious UCSD Graduate Students need to contact our office for submission -\nneurograd@health.ucsd.edu\nApplication Fee: ($135 U.S. citizens and permanent residents; $155 international)\n2) Statement of Purpose (750 word limit)\nFrom your Statement of Purpose, we hope to get a sense of what drives and motivates your passion for neuroscience research. To that end, writing about how your interest in the field developed can be insightful. In addition, please feel free to take this opportunity to discuss both the ups and downs of your path into scientific research or any perceived shortcomings in your application.\nHow did your life trajectory lead to applying to graduate school at UC San Diego? What drives your interest and passion for neuroscience?\n3) Research Statement (750 word limit)\nIf you have research experience, describe how this has shaped your scientific thinking. What are the neuroscience research questions you have worked on in the past? What outstanding questions in neuroscience would like to address with your future research? Focus on the science and approach. Assume an ideal scenario in which money, resources, etc. are not a concern.\nIn your research statement, try to refrain from listing all the techniques you have learned. Instead, tell us about what questions you have focused on, how you addressed them experimentally or analytically, and how your findings fit into the broader knowledge base of the field. Discuss experiences when your experiments answered a question (i.e., “worked”), as well as how you experienced times when experiments failed or offered ambiguous results. Describe the type of neuroscience research you would like to pursue during your PhD. As appropriate for you, contextualize these goals in terms of your past research, course work, life experience, and/or the environment at UC San Diego.\n4) Letters of Recommendation (3)\nYou are required to submit three letters of recommendation. Letters are encouraged to be from individuals who have supervised work in a research or academic setting.\nYou can submit your application without the letters of recommendation submitted\nIt is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure the recommenders can submit their letters by the deadline\n5) Exam Scores\nThe\nGRE\nis not required.\nInternational Applicants:\nSubmit Evidence of English Language Proficiency.
