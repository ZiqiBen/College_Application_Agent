  "raw_text": "Master's Programs\nThe Computer Science Department offers three different master’s options for students who have completed (or will complete) a bachelor’s degree and want to extend their training in computer science.\nOur largest program is the M.S. in Computer Science, which allows students with undergraduate degrees in computer science or another technical field to work with their academic advisor to create their own course of study. We also offer a fifth-year master’s program for current SCS undergraduates, and a 3-2 MBA program with CMU’s Tepper School of Business.\nM.S. in Computer Science\nThe Master of Science in Computer Science offers students with a bachelor's degree the opportunity to take their skills to the next level with advanced study.  We cater to students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, programming, and logical reasoning.  You don’t need a bachelor’s degree in computer science specifically for the program, but a technical undergraduate background will set you up for success.\nProgram Details\nFifth Year Master's Program\nWe designed the Fifth Year Master's Program specifically for students receiving a B.S. or double major in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. The program encourages our very brightest undergraduates to become involved with research that broadens their undergraduate experience. We also want to encourage a select group of students to continue to graduate school by providing them with an additional qualification and period of study beyond their undergraduate degree, resulting in a master’s degree in computer science.\nProgram Details\nAccelerated MBA Program\nStudents interested in earning their bachelor’s degree and MBA in five years may be interested in the Tepper School of Business’s Accelerated MBA program.
