If you are an existing NYU CS undergraduate, we also offer an\naccelerated BA-MS\nprogram.\nStudents who obtain a Master's of Science in Computer Science are qualified to do significant development work in the computer industry or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree are in a position to hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. Additionally, the department offers a Masters of Science in Information Systems in collaboration with the Stern School of Business. The emphasis in the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. The Master of Science in Scientific Computing, just established by the Mathematics and Computer Science Departments, is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications.\nEstablished in 1969 as part of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the department has experienced substantial growth in its faculty, student body, research staff, and funding. Research areas include algorithmics, computational geometry, high-level programming languages, compilers and compiler optimization techniques, parallel and distributed computing, design of computer systems, databases, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, graphics, multimedia, computer vision, mathematical programming, numerical analysis, computational biology and computational finance.\nThe core of the curriculum consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, and computational finance. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.\nThe Masters in Computer Science (MSCS) program is designed to make you a better thinker, a better programmer and a better system architect. It will also provide you with a good understanding of current technology. Our philosophy is to require you to master foundational topics and then let you specialize in application areas of your interest. You will gain a broad and deep understanding of many aspects of computer science, choosing among such fields as security and cryptography, graphics, scientific computing, programming languages, databases, networking, and distributed systems, to name a few. This may enable you to become a design lead in a complex multi-faceted project.\nAdmissions\nAll applicants to the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) are required to submit the\ngeneral application requirements\n, which include:\nAcademic Transcripts\nTest Scores\n(if required)\nApplicant Statements\nRésumé or Curriculum Vitae\nLetters of Recommendation\n, and\nA non-refundable\napplication fee\n.\nSee\nComputer Science\nfor admission requirements and instructions specific to this program.\nOn This Page\nProgram Requirements\nFoundational Course Requirement\nCapstone Requirement\nCapstone Course or Thesis\nConcentration in AI or Systems/Security\nFoundational Course Requirement\nCapstone Requirement\nConcentration Capstone Course\nProgram Requirements\nCourse List\nCourse\nTitle\nCredits\nFoundational Courses\nCSCI-GA 1170\nFundamental Algorithms\n3\nCSCI-GA 2110\nProgramming Languages\n3\nCSCI-GA 2250\nOperating Systems\n3\nElectives\nOther Elective Credits\n18\nCapstone\nSelect one of the following:\n3-6\nCapstone Course\nCSCI-GA 3840\nMaster's Thesis Research (fulfills capstone requirement)\nTotal Credits\n30\nFoundational Course Requirement\nTo fulfill the foundational course requirement, students must successfully complete all three foundational courses, CSCI-GA 1170 Fundamental Algorithms, CSCI-GA 2110 Programming Languages and CSCI-GA 2250 Operating Systems with at least a GPA of 2.666 or B- or higher average between the three courses.\nCapstone Requirement\nCapstone Course or Thesis\nTo fulfill the capstone requirement, students must successfully complete a capstone course with a grade of B or higher that represents a combination of the key elements of the MS program of study or with approval from the department, write a master’s thesis or complete (6 credits) or a capstone advanced lab (3 credits).
