Students are required to take a 0-credit course\nCHEM-GA 2673\nProfessional Development\n. During the first semester in residence and the\nCHEM-GA 3010\nGraduate Seminar in the fall semester of their second year. Students must attend a minimum of ten (10) colloquia/seminars prior to graduation. Courses taken outside of the Chemistry Department must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies.\nStudents may choose one of the two paths detailed below:\nThesis Path\nIn their first semester students must chose an advisor by submitting the\nMaster's Thesis Advisor Selection Form\nto the Graduate Program Administrator.\nIn the Thesis Masters Path, students must prepare a dissertation based on original research using the NYU Dissertation formatting requirements accompanied by an oral examination and defense of this research in the major field (thesis masters). The Master’s Thesis Examination Committee consists of three members of the faculty (one must be the thesis advisor). The Master’s thesis defense consists of an oral presentation by the student, approximately 45-50 minutes in length, which is open to the public. A closed-door question-and-answer section by the Master’s Thesis Examination Committee immediately follows the public presentation.\nAfter successful completion of their defense, students must submit. to the Graduate Program Administrator,  the\nGSAS Thesis Exam Form\nand\nDepartment Thesis Exam Form\nto be processed and for signatures to be collected.\nNon-Thesis Path\nNon-thesis Masters students must complete 30 credits in graduate lecture courses and the mandatory 0 credit\nCHEM-GA 2673\nProfessional Development and the 2 credit course\nCHEM-GA 3010\nGraduate Seminar\n, with a GPA of B (3.0) or better. In the Graduate Seminar course, students must research an important topic of chemistry from the literature (the topic has to be agreed on by the instructor on record for the seminar course), identify 3-5 publications that describe cutting edge research in the chosen topic, prepare and present in a public setting a 45 minute seminar on the chosen topic followed by a question and answer session from the audience. This literature review followed by a public presentation is viewed as the capstone requirement for this plan.\nCourse List\nCourse\nTitle\nCredits\nMajor Requirements\nCHEM-GA 2673\nProfessional Development\n1\n0\nCHEM-GA 3010\nGraduate Seminar\n2\n2\nElectives\nChemistry Electives\n30-32\nTotal Credits\n32\n1\nRequired for both Paths (Thesis and Non-Thesis)\n2\nRequired Non-Thesis path.\nSample Plan of Study\nPlan of Study Grid\n1st Semester/Term\nCredits\nChemistry Elective\n4\nChemistry Elective\n4\nCHEM-GA 2673\nProfessional Development\n0\nCredits\n8\n2nd Semester/Term\nChemistry Elective\n4\nChemistry Elective\n4\nCredits\n8\n3rd Semester/Term\nChemistry Elective\n4\nChemistry Elective\n4\nCHEM-GA 3010\nGraduate Seminar\n2\nCredits\n8\n4th Semester/Term\nChemistry Elective\n4\nChemistry Elective\n4\nCredits\n8\nTotal Credits\n32\nLearning Outcomes\nUpon successful completion of the program, graduates will:\nHave made a significant and original contribution to the field of chemistry.\nHave mastered the theories and concepts in their area of specialization.\nBe able to critically evaluate the scientific literature.\nBe able to think critically.\nPolicies\nOn This Page\nNYU Policies\nGraduate School of Arts and Science Policies\nNYU Policies\nUniversity-wide policies can be found on the\nNew York University Policy pages\n.\nGraduate School of Arts and Science Policies\nAcademic Policies for the Graduate School of Arts and Science can be found on the\nAcademic Policies page\n.",
