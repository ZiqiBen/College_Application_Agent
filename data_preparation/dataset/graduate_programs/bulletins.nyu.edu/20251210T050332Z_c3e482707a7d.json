  "raw_text": "On This Page\nProgram Description\nProgram Structure\nResearch and Arts Practice\nStudio Spaces\nAdmissions\nApplication\nAdmissions Process\nArtist's Portfolio\nProgram Description\nThe MFA in Art and Media is a full-time, studio-intensive interdisciplinary degree program that sits at the crossroads of practice and theory, tradition and change in the arts. The MFA program combines contemporary art and media practices with cultural heritage, art theory, media studies, and emergent technologies. Through critique and studio based instruction the MFA allows students to mix and blend concepts, skills, approaches and traditions from various topics across classes and seminars. Coursework and academic requirements are designed to foster the development of students who can think and create in novel and interdisciplinary ways. Students are asked to work across concepts and traditions to make a body of work that may not be in a single transition or body of knowledge. Courses emphasize artistic experimentation within a context of historical, cultural, and theoretical study.\nThe MFA in Art and Media prepares students for careers not only as artists or professionals in museums, the arts industries or education, but also for any career where creativity, imagination, analytical ability, conceptual clarity, cross cultural understanding and a respect for human achievement and difference are valued.\nProgram Structure\nStudents are required to complete 60-credits over two years of study and can choose to work in-depth in a particular area or across multiple arts disciplines, including: Sculpture, Photography, Printmaking, Fiber Art, Painting & Drawing, Digital Art, Design, Digital Media, and Transmedia (video, performance, digital). The program comprises eight required courses, including multiple instances of two distinct Critique classes; five studio electives and a required non-credit mid-program review at the end of the first year. Students have the option to complete two of their five elective courses during NYU’s J-term semester. The final semester of year two includes an 8-credit MFA thesis project and exhibition. The MFA thesis will culminate with a 90 minutes oral defense in the NYUAD art gallery before a faculty panel.\nResearch and Arts Practice\nThe goals of the program are manifold. It seeks to provide a flexible, supportive, and advanced studio-based learning environment that allows students to integrate art, media and design production, in combination with other disciplines, through creative processes that remix theory, methodology and practice. Its multidisciplinary coursework bridges disciplinary skills and diverse bodies of knowledge. The program is structured to ensure that students develop advanced research skills for visual and academic investigations in the areas of art, media and design practice and theory. Students will learn the perceptual and analytical skills used by artists and designers to engage with and move more thoughtfully through cultural spaces, environments, institutions, and the societies from which they come.\nThe MFA fosters competency in research, material knowledge, analysis, decision making, brainstorming and teamwork. Students will learn to visualize problems and ideas in novel ways, connect seemingly unconnected phenomena and concepts, and provide valuable insights into and solutions to contemporary problems. Such work contributes to our aesthetic and social development and drives cultural, technological, and economic innovation.\nStudio Spaces\nNYU Abu Dhabi offers state-of-the-art production facilities in sculpture, design, printmaking, fiber art, photography, interactive media, painting and drawing, fiber arts, digital art, sound art, and film. Students enrolled in the program will be assigned large private studios which will serve as a core teaching and research spaces.\nAdmissions\nApplications for Fall 2024 will open in October, 2023.\nYou must have completed a four-year bachelor’s degree before the program registration starts.

Their art works are brought to a high polish and are suitable for exhibition. Materials and modes of display are treated with expertise and fluency, and this is evidenced in final exhibitions as well as open studio events throughout their two-year program.\nArt Discourse and Research:\nStudents learn and use art historical and practice-based terminology to discuss their own work, the work of others, and to interpret and explain artworks. They can relate what they analyze to the wider discourse of visual arts in contemporary culture, regionally and globally. Students demonstrate capability in information gathering, documentation, investigation, analysis, interpretation, and evaluation of sources about artworks and practices. This is evidenced in written artist statements, informal talks about their works, and in their written reviews of other artworks.\nProfessional Development and Leadership:\nStudents understand career models and issues in professional ethics, and understand their unique position, regionally, in contributing to the development of arts programming and communities. As students they are involved in regional cultural organizations and seek to create opportunities for the growing regional art community. Students are adept at initiating or originating and uniting others around a shared goal or practice and incorporating perspectives of others as well as their own in an initiative. This is evidenced in artist-as-curator events, formal and informal studio visits across Abu Dhabi and within the NYUAD community, as well as artists actively writing reviews and participating in the discourse of art regionally.\nVisual Communication and Literacy:\nStudents are accomplished at representing their ideas visually and symbolically. Students are adept at analyzing, interpreting, and explaining images, and can relate what they analyze to the wider discourse of visual arts in contemporary culture, regionally and globally. Students demonstrate proficiency in manners of engaged, rigorous, and careful evaluation, interpretation, and explication.\nInformation on Institutional Research Policies and Policies and Procedures on Projects, Theses, and Dissertations, including registration, proposal submission and approval, selection of principal supervisor, graduate committees, seminar requirements, external readers, final examinations/defences, revisions, award of degree, intellectual property rights and copyrights; can be found online at\nFacilities and Support\n.\nPolicies\nOn This Page\nNYU Policies\nNYU Abu Dhabi Policies\nNYU Policies\nUniversity-wide policies can be found on the\nNew York University Policy pages\n.\nNYU Abu Dhabi Policies\nAll NYU Abu Dhabi Graduate policies can be found on the school's\nacademic policy page\n.",

Their art works are brought to a high polish and are suitable for exhibition. Materials and modes of display are treated with expertise and fluency, and this is evidenced in final exhibitions as well as open studio events throughout their two-year program. Art Discourse and Research: Students learn and use art historical and practice-based terminology to discuss their own work, the work of others, and to interpret and explain artworks. They can relate what they analyze to the wider discourse of visual arts in contemporary culture, regionally and globally. Students demonstrate capability in information gathering, documentation, investigation, analysis, interpretation, and evaluation of sources about artworks and practices. This is evidenced in written artist statements, informal talks about their works, and in their written reviews of other artworks. Professional Development and Leadership: Students understand career models and issues in professional ethics, and understand their unique position, regionally, in contributing to the development of arts programming and communities. As students they are involved in regional cultural organizations and seek to create opportunities for the growing regional art community. Students are adept at initiating or originating and uniting others around a shared goal or practice and incorporating perspectives of others as well as their own in an initiative. This is evidenced in artist-as-curator events, formal and informal studio visits across Abu Dhabi and within the NYUAD community, as well as artists actively writing reviews and participating in the discourse of art regionally. Visual Communication and Literacy: Students are accomplished at representing their ideas visually and symbolically. Students are adept at analyzing, interpreting, and explaining images, and can relate what they analyze to the wider discourse of visual arts in contemporary culture, regionally and globally. Students demonstrate proficiency in manners of engaged, rigorous, and careful evaluation, interpretation, and explication.",
