MEAM MSE students may submit a petition using the MEAM MSE Academic Program Request Form . MEAM 6990: MEAM Seminar MEAM 6990 recognizes students’ attendance at the MEAM Seminar Series. MEAM 6990 is a zero (0) credit course that does not count towards a student’s full-time status or the MEAM MSE program’s 10 CU requirement. There are no tuition or fees assessed for this course. MEAM 6990 is graded Satisfactory (S)/Unsatisfactory (U) and recorded on a student’s transcript. To earn an S grade, the student must attend at least 70% of the departmental seminars and complete mini-essays for at least three of those seminars. For example, in a term in which there are 12 seminars, the student will need to attend at least 9 seminars to obtain an S grade. The three mini-essays can be spread over the semester (approximately one a month). Students may select which seminars they write the mini-essays about. Students may attend and count up to two seminars outside of MEAM’s Seminar Series. To be counted, a non-MEAM seminar must be part of an established Penn seminar series that is focused on engineering, science, mathematics, computation, or another technical discipline. Students may also count attendance at MEAM PhD and Master’s defenses towards MEAM 6990 with prior approval. A mini-essay must be completed for each non-MEAM seminar, and these may count towards the mini-essay requirement. There are no exams for this course. Independent Study Independent study courses (MEAM 5990) can accommodate special interests of the students that are not served through Penn Engineering’s regular course offerings.

MEAM 5990: Independent Study MEAM 5990 may only count towards the General Elective requirement, and students may only take a maximum of two independent study courses towards their MEAM MSE degree. The faculty supervisor must be a primary member of MEAM’s faculty. If the faculty supervisor is not a primary member of MEAM’s faculty, the student may request to do an independent study in the supervisor’s primary department. Prior to the semester in which the student wants to take the independent study, the student and the faculty supervisor must develop a proposal: The first section of the proposal should describe the objectives, scope, content, and schedule of the independent study. The second section should state how the independent study will be evaluated and how the student will be graded. The proposal should be signed by both the student and the faculty supervisor and then be submitted to the Graduate Program Coordinator, who will convey it to the Master’s Program Chair for approval. Students should use the MEAM 5990 & 9990 Proposal Submission Form to submit the proposal to the department. The student must submit their independent study proposal with the approval form signed by their Independent Study Supervisor by three (3) weeks before the start of the semester in which the independent study will commence. The following guidelines will help maintain the academic rigor of an independent study course: An independent study course should require a comparable amount of work to that of a regular course, about 9 hours a week, or a total of 126 hours per semester. The student and faculty supervisor should meet on a regular basis – we recommend at least once a week. It is the student’s responsibility to schedule these weekly meetings.

Failure to follow these guidelines may result in the student not receiving credit for the independent study course. MEAM MSE Thesis Option While the majority of MSE students complete an entirely coursework-based degree, there is also an option to complete a thesis during the MSE degree program. This option is open only to top MSE students and is subject to the availability of advisors with suitable research projects. Students doing a thesis typically complete the MSE in 2 years. Objectives of an MSE thesis project can include the following: To advance the state-of-the-art in research. To solve new problems with existing tools. To develop a new instrument or measurement technique, or a computer program for analysis or advanced design. MEAM 9990: Master’s Thesis Research Students may take MEAM 9990 for up to three semesters, although the typically suggested length is 2 semesters. MEAM 9990 can be counted towards up to two (2) of the MEAM Electives requirement. One, two, or three units of MEAM 9990 may be taken in sequence, not simultaneously. Students should expect to take at least two semesters for the project and thesis writing. MEAM 9990 is graded by the student’s thesis advisor. Students may take MEAM 5990 (Independent Study) for one semester and then expand the project into a thesis by taking MEAM 9990 for a second semester of the project.

The thesis committee will evaluate the entire scope of the thesis, including the work completed during the Independent Study. Students hoping to extend their Independent Study project into a thesis are not guaranteed that their proposals will be approved. Students who choose to expand their independent study into a thesis, may petition to count MEAM 5990 towards their MEAM Electives requirement if their thesis proposal is approved. Students may not combine two Independent Study courses and call them a thesis. Students doing a thesis cannot count independent study courses (MEAM 5990) as a part of their 10 course units requirement.

The new MEAM curriculum consists of 37 CUs rather than 40 CUs. Students will no longer be required to take chemistry lab (CHEM 1101). A new (required) sophomore-level course, MEAM 2020, will introduce students to fundamental topics in thermal and fluids engineering. Students will have the option to declare a concentration in one of three areas of focus: (i) Dynamics, Controls, and Robotics; (ii) Energy, Fluids, and Thermal Systems; and (iii) Mechanics of Materials, Structures and Design. Do I have to declare a concentration? No , concentrations are optional. If you do not declare a concentration, you must follow the “general curriculum” as outlined in the BSE requirements and MEAM undergraduate handbook. Note that the “general curriculum” is the default curriculum for all incoming freshmen. Whether you follow the general curriculum or declare a concentration, you are required to take 37 CUs for your MEAM BSE degree. I’ve heard that CHEM 1012 and BIOL 1121 have lab components. Am I required to take those? We only require that you enroll in the lecture component (equivalent to 1 CU) of one of these courses. When registering in Penn in Touch, you should look for “CHEM 1012” or “BIOL 1121.” EAS 091 credit will also satisfy this requirement. Is there a social science and humanities depth requirement? For students who entered in fall 2020 and after, there is not a depth requirement for social sciences and humanities. Can I declare more than one concentration? MEAM students may only formally declare one concentration. I entered MEAM prior to fall 2020. Can I use the new 37 CUs worksheet?

If you matriculated prior to fall 2020, you must use your class year’s worksheet. You may not use or petition to use the new 37 CUs worksheet. I enrolled as a sophomore-level transfer student in fall 2020. Which version of the curriculum do I follow? You should follow the curriculum that corresponds to the year you would have entered Penn as a freshman: in this case, you would be following the curriculum for students who entered in fall 2019 (40 CUs curriculum). Advising and registration What courses should I plan to take this semester? The MEAM undergraduate handbook contains a sample schedule for students in the major. You should consult your entering class’s handbook (transfer students should consult the handbook that corresponds with the year they would have entered as freshmen). The sample schedules included in the handbook are just an example of the common trajectory for MEAM students. If you believe you have an unusual academic circumstance and are unsure of what to take next, you should consult with your faculty advisor or the Undergraduate Program Coordinator. What should I do if I haven’t fulfilled the prerequisite for a MEAM course? The MEAM curriculum follows a specific structure in which core courses build upon foundational principles and concepts in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Thus, it is very important for you to stay on track with your STEM requirements. If, however, you have an extenuating circumstance and you do not meet the prerequisites for a specific course, you should initiate a conversation with the instructor about your background prior to the start of the course. Enrollment is at the instructor’s discretion in these cases The course I want to register for appears to be full. What should I do?

You can also check with the course’s academic department to see if a waitlist is being maintained for the course. How do I find out what courses can count as a math requirement, natural science requirement, social science, etc.? You should always reference the Penn Engineering undergraduate handbook course category lists . When in doubt, check with the MEAM Undergraduate Program Coordinator for a course’s most appropriate classification. For students entering in fall 2020 and after, any course that Penn Engineering considers to be math, natural science or engineering may be used as a technical elective. For students entering prior to fall 2020, any course that Penn Engineering considers to be math, natural science or engineering may be used for a professional elective requirement within the professional electives section of the worksheet. How can I pursue an Independent Study (MEAM 0099)? An Independent Study provides an opportunity to work closely with a professor: In a research effort to develop research skills and technique and/or To develop a program of independent in-depth study in a subject area in which you and the professor share a common interest Course credit for an Independent Study is granted through registering for MEAM 0099. To register for MEAM 0099, you and the professor must jointly submit a detailed proposal, subject to approval by the MEAM Undergraduate Curriculum Chair. You may apply a maximum of 2 CU of MEAM 0099 towards your degree requirements. For students entering in fall 2020 and after, MEAM 0099 may be used as a technical elective.

      "text": "professor share a common interest Course credit for an Independent Study is granted through registering for MEAM 0099. To register for MEAM 0099, you and the professor must jointly submit a detailed proposal, subject to approval by the MEAM Undergraduate Curriculum Chair. You may apply a maximum of 2 CU of MEAM 0099 towards your degree requirements. For students entering in fall 2020 and after, MEAM 0099 may be used as a technical elective. For students entering prior to fall 2020, MEAM 099 may be used for a professional elective requirement within the professional electives section of the worksheet. What counts as a MEAM upper level course? Any course at the 5000-level that is listed with a MEAM prefix counts as a MEAM upper level (eg. MEAM 5100), excluding MEAM 5990. If a course is cross-listed, MEAM majors should take the course under the MEAM cross-listing. If you are a student who has entered in fall 2020 or after, you should consult your MEAM undergraduate handbook for a list of acceptable upper level courses for your chosen concentration. Can I take a course other than EAS 203 for the Ethics requirement? If you are a MEAM single degree student, no : EAS 2030 is the only accepted course for the ethics requirement. If you are a M&T student, you may petition to count LGST 1000 for the ethics requirement, and if you are a VIPER student, you may apply VIPR 120/1210 to the requirement. Petitions will not be considered for other circumstances. How can I plan for a minor or accelerated master’s in addition to my MEAM BSE degree? With careful planning, many engineering minors and other Penn minors fit into the MEAM degree requirements with minimal disruption or additional credits. You should review the requirements for your intended minor to see where areas of overlap might occur with the MEAM major. If you have specific questions about cross-counting courses for your major and minor, you should speak with the coordinator for the minor and/or the MEAM Undergraduate Program Coordinator. Remember that your primary focus should always be on completing your undergraduate major requirements . Students pursuing the accelerated master’s in MEAM will typically use their three required MEAM Upper Level courses as the double counts between their undergraduate and master’s degrees.

I’m interested in study abroad. Where should I start? The Steps to Study Abroad page contains a checklist of to-dos and contacts if you are planning to study abroad. The MEAM Undergraduate Program Coordinator can assist you with understanding the XCAT submission process and MEAM-specific study abroad guidelines, once you have already met with a Penn Global Advisor. Can I take classes at another institution over the summer? Yes, but there are limits. The MEAM department does not allow for MEAM majors to complete major-required coursework (including the MEAM Core, Concentration Courses, and MEAM Upper Levels) to be completed at other institutions. If you are seeking to take a course in another department (eg. chemistry, biology), you should consult that Penn department’s webpage or with the program’s coordinator to confirm whether it is possible to receive credit away. If the department allows for these requests, you must submit course information and the credit request through the XCAT system. You can read more about Penn Engineering’s credit away policy here . I want to change my faculty advisor assignment. How do I do that? Send a request to the MEAM Undergraduate Program Coordinator. It is helpful if you can say what you are looking for in a new advisor (specific research area, familiarity with a certain industry, etc.) or if you have a particular advisor in mind. I’m currently in another major, but I want to switch to MEAM. What should I do? If you are currently a Penn Engineering student, you will need to complete the change of curriculum form , which requires your current faculty advisor’s signature. For questions about the MEAM major and its curriculum, or to submit your change of curriculum form, contact the MEAM Undergraduate Program Coordinator. If you are enrolled in another undergraduate school, you will need to follow the process for a transfer to Penn Engineering. Contact the MEAM Undergraduate Program Coordinator",

Contact the MEAM Undergraduate Program Coordinator for any MEAM-specific questions Policies and procedures I want to take more than 5.5 CUs. How do I request a credit increase? You may only request an increase beyond 5.5 CUs if you have already completed a full semester at Penn and are in good academic standing. Only dual degree students may request credit increases during the advance registration period; single degree MEAM students must wait to request a credit increase until after their most recent semester grades have posted. You will need your faculty advisor’s approval for an increase. You can view a flowchart outlining the MEAM credit increase process here . What’s a petition? How do I submit one? A “petition for action” is a special form that is required whenever you are attempting to deviate from Penn Engineering course requirements. It is wise to discuss your petition with your Faculty Advisor or the Undergraduate Program Coordinator before submitting ; all petitions must now go through an electronic review workflow. During the academic year, petitions are reviewed weekly. In order to be reviewed at the weekly meeting, all fully-completed petitions must be received by Tuesdays at noon . Because the electronic petitions queue requires several levels of review and approval, please be sure to submit your request well in advance of the weekly deadline. Some circumstances require the use of the MEAM core requirement substitution form; more information is found in a subsequent dropdown on this same page. I was told that I need to submit a “detailed academic plan” as part of my petition.

What exactly is a “detailed academic plan?” A detailed academic plan should clearly outline the courses/requirements you have already fulfilled and the courses/requirements you intend to take, in a semester-by-semester view up to graduation. The detailed academic plan should confirm that you are on track to complete your undergraduate degree requirements and that you are taking a reasonable course load each semester. When creating your academic plan, be sure to list the course number, credits (CUs), and satisfied requirement for each course. What’s the MEAM core requirement substitution form? The MEAM core requirement substitution form is a special form that is needed whenever you are attempting to deviate from MEAM degree requirements, specifically in the Engineering, Professional Electives, and/or MEAM Core sections of your worksheet. Completed forms should be submitted to the Undergraduate Program Coordinator for review and processing. I should have retroactive credit for a mathematics course, but I do not see it reflected on my worksheet. What should I do? Retroactive credit is not awarded automatically. Instead, you must visit the math department in DRL and fill out the request form for retroactive credit. Please do not wait until senior year to make this request . Once your retroactive credit is approved, you should see it appear on both your transcript and your worksheet. You can read about the math department’s retroactive credit policy here . Research and careers in MEAM How do I get involved in research? Many MEAM students pursue research opportunities throughout their undergraduate careers. A good place to start is by (i) talking to your academic advisor and (ii) reviewing the main research areas of MEAM faculty ; each hyperlinked faculty profile contains more information on that faculty member’s research. It’s also wise to keep up with our MEAM news , where you can find more details about specific innovations and projects. Once you have identified faculty or research labs of interest, we recommend reaching out to those faculty to see if any opportunities might be available.

How can I learn about what careers MEAM students pursue after graduation? MEAM graduates pursue a variety of career paths and advanced degrees. Recent first destinations for our alumni include Apple, BCG, Boeing, Microsoft, SpaceX, and the Walt Disney Company. We encourage you to review the Career Services post-graduate outcomes page for additional employer destinations. Every fall, the MEAM department hosts a Student Development Career Series , culminating in an Alumni Panel. At this event, current undergraduates have the opportunity to hear from program alumni about their career paths. The ASME student chapter also hosts an annual networking dinner. If you are a MEAM alum who might be interested in participating in a future event, please contact the MEAM Undergraduate Program Coordinator. Prospective student information and program facilities I am a prospective student interested in MEAM. Who can I talk to about the program? We’re so glad that you are interested in becoming a part of our department!
