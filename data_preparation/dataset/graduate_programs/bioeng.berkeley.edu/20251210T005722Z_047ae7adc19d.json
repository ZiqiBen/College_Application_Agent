Undergrad Menu Degree Requirements for the Bioengineering Major The Bioengineering degree requires 120 semester units of courses, described below, which include certain university and college requirements. Our four concentration areas help students construct a 4-year plan to build a useful and marketable skill set for work in one of the many subspecialties of bioengineering. The sample program for each concentration should be used as a guide to selecting courses that build on each other. All of the concentrations share the same first Fall semester, which includes BioE 10: Introduction to Biomedicine for Engineers BioE 26: Introduction to Bioengineering Math 1A: Calculus Chem 1A/L: General Chemistry and Lab a Humanities elective The BioE 10 and BioE 26 courses are designed to help students choose their concentration by introducing the available specialties and their applications.

The capstone course gives students deep exposure to realistic challenges in the dynamic and stimulating clinical and commercial medical technology environment. Learning to embed in, interface with, and understand diverse technical environments is a key aspect of the experience, as is acquiring the ability to grasp and address an ambiguous problem in biomedicine. In collaboration with a diverse set of physician “clients” in varied clinical specialties at UCSF, Stanford, UC Davis, and internationally, small student teams develop and test promising novel medical device solutions during a 15-week course. These projects provide the focus for students to work through one iteration of the engineering design process: needs refinement and formulation, setting target specifications, concept generation and down-selection, specification refinement, functional prototyping, testing, and redesign. Three formal design reviews are conducted, with process outcomes formalized in oral and written documentation. Teamwork is a core aspect of the experience, including interaction with physicians. Course content is augmented with invited guest lectures from industry, regulatory professionals, and clinical practice. Course goals Provide engineering design training while creating an intellectual environment in which interdisciplinary innovation is promoted and encouraged.
