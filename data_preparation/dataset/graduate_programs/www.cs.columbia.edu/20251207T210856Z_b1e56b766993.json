  "raw_text": "MASTER OF SCIENCE PROGRAM\nThe Master of Science (MS) program is intended for people who wish to broaden and deepen their understanding of Computer Science. Columbia University and the New York City environment provide excellent career opportunities in multiple industries.\nThe program provides a unique opportunity to develop leading-edge in-depth knowledge of specific computer science disciplines. The department currently offers faculty-determined pathways covering eight such disciplines. MS students are encouraged to participate in state-of-the-art research with our research groups and labs.\nREQUIREMENTS\nComplete a total of\n30 points\n(Courses must be at the 4000 level or above)\nMaintain at least a\n2.7\noverall GPA. (No more than 1 D is permitted). The full Academic Standing Policy can be found\nhere\n.\nComplete the\nColumbia Engineering Professional Development & Leadership (PDL)\nrequirement (Not applicable to CVN students)\nSatisfy\nbreadth requirements\nTake at least\n6 points\nof technical courses at the 6000 level\nAt most, up to\n3 points\nof your degree can be Non-CS/Non-pathway if they are deemed relevant to your pathway and sufficiently technical in nature. Please submit the course syllabus to your CS Faculty Advisor for review, and then forward the approval confirmation email to\nms-advising@cs.columbia.edu\nPATHWAY OPTIONS\nFor robust understanding and competency in one of the computer science disciplines, students should choose one of the pathways below. View each webpage for details on key and elective courses.\nComputational Biology\nNetwork Systems\nComputer Security\nSoftware Systems\nFoundations of Computer Science\nVision, Graphics, Interaction, and Robotics\nMachine Learning\nMS Personalized (by faculty invite only)\nNatural Language Processing\nMS Thesis (by faculty invite only)\nColumbia Video Network (CVN) students should also choose from one of the above pathways. For faculty advisement, please contact the assigned pathway\nadvisors\n.\nCS MS FACULTY PATHWAY ADVISORS\nCS Faculty Pathway Advisors\nwill be assigned after you select a pathway in Mice. If you do not yet have a Mice account but are a CS MS student, please contact\nms-advising@cs.columbia.edu\n. Contact your Faculty Pathway Advisor to get special permission for any course not specifically approved on your\nCS Pathway websites\n.\nDEGREE PROGRESS CHECKLIST\nStudents should keep an updated copy of their\nDegree Progress Checklist\non hand for any academic progress reviews with their Faculty and/or Admin advisor. This form will also be requested a few weeks before graduation to verify your program requirements are met.\nHOW TO FILL OUT YOUR CHECKLIST:\nList all coursework that should be used to meet your CS MS program requirements.\nFor all topics courses (COMS 4995 & COMS 6998 courses), remember to include the actual course title (for example, use “COMS 4995 Hacking for Defense” NOT “COMS 4995”).\nFor all Projects courses (COMS 6901), include the name of the instructor and how many points the course was worth.\nFor all Thesis courses (COMS 6902), include the name of the instructor and how many points the course was worth.\nFor all Personalized Pathway students, include the name of your advisor on your checklist.\nFor Advanced standing – mark which courses are approved by SEAS Academics.\nFor waived courses, list which course you are using to satisfy the points requirement for the waived course.\nChecklist Review Submission\nTOPICS COURSES\nIf you are interested in applying a specialized Topics in Computer Science courses (COMS 4995 or COMS 6998) to your Pathway electives, please view\nTopics Courses by Pathway Approval\n.\nStudents may take multiple sections of COMS 4995 and/or COMS 6998, as each topic title will vary by content each semester.
