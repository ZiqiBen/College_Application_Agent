Cross-listed courses this Spring BINF GU 4008 Section 3 / COMS 4995 Section 14: Advanced Machine Learning for Health and Medicine Machine Learning (ML) has transformative potential for applications in health and medicine. The complexity of healthcare and medicine has highlighted foundational challenges in ML such as lack of generalization, robustness, safety, inequity, and statistical interpretability. Traditional ways of measuring the utility of ML models often do not reflect clinical/medical benefits resulting in technical innovations in ML methods. Exciting opportunities have opened up for methodological progress in Machine Learning motivated by health and medicine applications. The availability of large de-identified multi-institutional datasets for healthcare and medicine from around the world has accelerated progress in ML for health. These data are from healthcare providers and are patient-facing as opposed to traditional medical data, which is well-curated and collected for specific tasks. Patient-facing datasets are rife with some of the most complex statistical artifacts that require innovative ML solutions to improve over the state-of-the-art in health and medicine. In this course, you will learn about complexities that make health and medicine data unique and how it opens up opportunities for advanced AI. You will learn advanced Machine Learning methods useful in health and medicine applications, for example, time-series modeling, reinforcement learning, probabilistic modeling, causal inference, foundation models, unsupervised learning, and self-supervised learning. I will further provide an overview of challenges such as fairness, interpretability, generalization, robustness, safety, and policy implications of ML in health and medicine. The course will train students to map real-world challenges of working with health and medical data to statistical challenges that require new and advanced ML methods.

New for Spring 2026 COMS BC 3997 004 AI Investigation of 1921 Tulsa Massacre | Corey Toler-Franklin (Undergrads only) This undergraduate course is designed for juniors and seniors and covers advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) relevant to historic forensic investigation. Through a series of project-based assignments that focus on topics presented in lectures and discussions, students work in groups to develop neural network architectures, data analysis and 3D reconstruction methods to support the ongoing investigation of the Tulsa Race Massacre (TRM) of 1921. This catastrophic event resulted in the loss of lives, homes and the decimation of the thriving business district of Greenwood. Forensic scientists, historians and other specialists on the (TRM) investigative team, and descendants of TRM survivors interact with students through guest lectures and a field trip to Tulsa investigation sites to solve computational problems related to social network reconstruction, human identification and 3D reconstruction from multimedia data analysis. Project outcomes will be presented as a holographic display at the Greenwood Cultural Center (GCC) in Tulsa Oklahoma. Prerequisites : COMS W3157 Advanced Programming (or equivalent proficiency in C, C++, and/or Python), Linear Algebra: MATH UN2010 or MATH UN2015 (or equivalent knowledge of vectors and matrices).

COMS 4995 009 THRY ML INTERACT DECISION | Adam Block This course provides an introduction to the mathematical foundations of learning in interactive environments. We begin by briefly reviewing fundamental tools from learning theory, like concentration inequalities (Hoeffding, Bernstein) and their applications to generalization and regret analysis, before developing core algorithms for online learning and decision making. The second half of the course explores sequential and interactive settings such as multi-armed and contextual bandits as well as Reinforcement and Imitation Learning, emphasizing general algorithmic principles. We will conclude, time permitting, with a discussion of the special case of Language Models, investigating the extent to which the additional structure afforded in this setting allows for new and better algorithm design and analysis. Students are expected to be familiar with the basics of probability and machine learning at the level of a first course in these topics. Grading will depend on problem sets and a final project involving an exposition on recent papers relevant to the course topics. COMS 4995 010 AI for Software Security | Zhou Zhang This course discusses how modern AI, particularly large language models, can transform software security and program analysis.

COMS 6998 001 TPCS GEOMETRY PROCESSING | Silvia Sellan Course Description This is a graduate seminar course in 3D Geometry Processing. Each week, we will discuss a different topic by reading papers from the most well-known venues in the field: from surface representations to reconstruction, parametrization, skinning, correspondence, modeling and geometric deep learning. Attendance is required and every student will be expected to speak during each class. Prerequisites Students should have taken an Introduction Computer Graphics (4160) or a similar course to be able to follow the course material courses. A medium programming proficiency in a C++ or Python is also recommended. COMS 6998 005 FINE GRAINED COMPLEXITY | Josh Alman The theory of NP-hardness is able to distinguish between “easy” problems that have polynomial-time algorithms, and “hard” problems that are NP-hard. However, it is often not reasonable to label any problem with a polynomial-time algorithm as “easy”, and in practice, it can make a huge difference whether an algorithm runs in, say, linear time, quadratic time, or cubic time. Nonetheless, the theory of NP-hardness is “too coarse” to make distinctions like this. Fine-Grained Complexity is a new area which aims to address this issue. The theory involves careful “fine-grained reductions” between problems which show that a polynomial speedup for one problem would give a polynomial speedup for another. Through a web of such reductions, Fine-Grained Complexity identifies a small number of algorithmic problems whose best-known algorithms are conjectured to be optimal, and shows that assuming these conjectures, a wide variety of algorithms in many seemingly-different areas must also be optimal. In this class, we will explore this new area and a variety of applications. We will study problems like Orthogonal Vectors, 3-SUM, and All-Pairs Shortest Paths, which are at the center of these conjectures, and see why we believe they are (or aren’t?) difficult. We will give fine-grained reductions from these problems to",

We will give fine-grained reductions from these problems to problems in many areas, including dynamic and approximation algorithms problems. We will also study the related area of parameterized complexity, which shows how NP-hard problems can become tractable when certain parameters describing the input are guaranteed to be small. Evaluation will be primarily based on a final project. I will provide a list of suggestions for the project, but students are encouraged to relate their project to their interests. There will also be occasional (at most 3) homework assignments, and students will be asked to scribe a lecture. Prerequisites: This is an advanced topics class in theoretical computer science, but it is open to everyone. The most important prerequisite is mathematical maturity (comfort with understanding and writing mathematical proofs). Students should also be very comfortable with algorithmic concepts and NP-completeness (e.g., from CSOR 4231). COMS 6998 006 QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION | Henry Yuen The most important challenge facing the construction of a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer is correcting errors and handling noise in quantum devices. This course will cover the fundamentals of quantum error correction and quantum fault-tolerance. We will cover topics such as: basic codes (Shor, Steane), the stabilizer formalism, CSS codes, topological codes (surface codes and beyond), Eastin-Knill theorem, quantum LDPC codes, the Quantum Threshold Theorem, and more. Assessments are comprised of problem sets and a class project. Students must have taken COMS 4281 – Intro to Quantum Computing or an equivalent course. Additionally, students are expected to have high levels of mathematical maturity (e.g., comfort with proofs, discrete math, linear algebra, and probability theory). Coursework in theoretical computer science classes (such as complexity theory and algorithms) is highly recommended.

There has been a flurry of recent developments in this area, with a wide variety of formulations of neural architectures and optimization algorithms. Some of these approaches take inspiration from neuroscience and cognitive science, while other forms of memory are primarily motivated by engineering. Each week, we will discuss a topic and read papers in this area. Presentations will be led by the students, the TAs, and the instructor. Attendance is required and students will be required to read all papers, lead some discussions, and complete a course project. Prerequisites: COMS 4776, Neural Networks and Deep Learning or equivalent. COMS 4995 TOPICS COURSES COMS 4995 TOPICS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE COMS W4995 Advanced Algorithms | Alexandr Andoni The class covers classic and modern algorithmic ideas that are central to many areas of Computer Science. The focus is on most powerful paradigms and techniques of how to design algorithms, and measure their efficiency. The topics will include hashing, sketching, dimension reduction, spectral graph theory, optimization (linear programming, gradient descent, IPM), multiplicative weights, compressed sensing, and others. The class is designed as a “grad intro to algorithms” class, and is thus an advanced version of “Analysis of Algorithms” (COMS 4231), both in terms of content as well as pace. You need not have taken 4231, but some algorithmic exposure is expected (see prerequisites below). Hence it is suitable for those of you who have seen some algorithms class (like 4231 or easier), and/or want to take an in-depth algorithms class. The evaluation is based on homeworks and a final project.” COMS 4995",

Prerequisites: Graduate standing or senior undergraduate and an interest in the use of programming languages and tools. Note: There will be no recording or remote access. Abstract: This course will use the C++ language and some C++ libraries as examples of software design and design decisions. It is not a C++ programming course though it will use the principles and design decisions that underly the major C++ features as prime examples and see how they are expressed in actual features and libraries. The evolution of those ideals and the support offered is also examined. Some experience with C++ and other languages is assumed. The book “A Tour of C++ (3rd edition)” will be read over the first half of the course to give the students a common foundation in C++. “Design” is not primarily a book skill; it involves a variety of principles and techniques that must be practiced for mastery. Consequently, the second half of the course is devoted to 3-person projects involving design, implementation, documentation, and presentation of projects of the students’ choice (after approval from the professor). Students are expected to attend other students’ presentations and see how they are expressed in actual features and libraries. The evolution of those ideals and the support offered is also examined.

This software revolution is driven primarily by two technology trends. On the client side, billions of users now own computers and smartphones with broadband Internet access, providing each of them “instant access to the full power of the Internet, every moment of every day.” On the backend, cloud services and readily available software tools vastly simplify creating software startups in many industries, without the need to invest in infrastructure or employee training. For instance, when WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook for approximately $19.3 billion dollars, it powered hundreds of millions of users worldwide but had merely 50 employees. These technology trends not only enable software to flourish, but also fundamentally change our software engineering process. Broadband access enables developers to run their software in the cloud for users to access via browsers or mobile apps — so-called Software-as-a-Services (SaaS). The developers of SaaS products continuously gather user feedback and behavior analytics, quickly refine existing or build new product features, and deploy to production in matter of minutes to test out their ideas — so called Agile Development. This style of close collaboration with customers and fast iteration of product ideas is in stark contrast with how software was engineered two decades ago. In this course, we will study modern software engineering practices including including topics such as SaaS architecture, behavior-driven development, Ruby on Rails, and Dev/ops. For details on the topics we will cover, please check out the Course Syllabus page.

COMS 4995 HACKING 4 DEFENSE | Blaer, Paul Couse Website Solve complex technology problems critical to our National Security with a team of engineers, scientists, MBAs, and policy experts. In a crisis, national security initiatives move at the speed of a startup yet in peacetime they default to decades-long acquisition and procurement cycles. Startups operate with continual speed and urgency 24/7. Over the last few years they’ve learned how to be not only fast, but extremely efficient with resources and time using lean startup methodologies. In this class student teams develop technology solutions to help solve important national security problems. Student teams take actual national security problems and learn how to apply the Lean launchpad and Lean Startup principles, (“business model canvas,” “customer development,” and “agile engineering”) to discover and validate customer needs and to continually build iterative prototypes to test whether they understood the problem and solution. Teams take a hands-on approach requiring close engagement with actual military, Department of Defense and other government agency end-users. Team applications required. Limited enrollment. Taught by Professor Paul Blaer and Jason Cahill, Hacking for Defense™ is a university-sponsored class that allows students to develop a deep understanding of the problems and needs of government sponsors in the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community. In a short time, students rapidly iterate prototypes and produce solutions to sponsors’ needs. This course provides students with an experiential opportunity to become more effective in their chosen field, with a body of work to back it up. For government agencies, it allows problem sponsors to increase the speed at which their organization solves specific, mission-critical problems.

Machine learning algorithms allow computers to learn from example data, and produce a program that does the job. Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithm originally inspired by the brain, but which have recently have seen a lot of success at practical applications. They are at the heart of production systems at companies like Google and Facebook for image processing, speech-to-text, and language understanding. This course gives an overview of both the foundational ideas and the recent advances in neural net algorithms. Roughly the first 2/3 of the course focuses on supervised learning — training the network to produce a specified behavior when one has lots of labeled examples of that behavior. The last 1/3 focuses on unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.

Our work will be dedicated to leveraging technology to support public interest organizations. We will move beyond short-term metrics—clicks, daily active users, and private profit—to focus on fostering long-term value and local networks. Students will work together to create and deploy interdisciplinary projects in collaborative teams, with the aim of serving the public and using technology to advance justice, equality, and inclusion in society. We will also be alert to the ways in which the language of “public interest” can sometimes hide or offer alibis for other political or private interests. For the first half of the semester, coding and design exercises, and complete short readings on journalism, urban planning, and public interest technology. During the second half of the semester students will iterate their work and put their projects into action.

This course will develop some of these techniques and explore a broad range of applications. We will mostly see applications to algorithm design and complexity theory, but we will touch on applications to other areas as well. The course will focus on four main topics: Algebraic graph algorithms. The fastest known algorithms for several important graph problems use algebraic tools. Often, the graph problem appears (at first glance) to have nothing to do with algebra, and algorithm designers have found surprising algebraic connections. The polynomial method. If one can capture a computational task using a simple polynomial, then fast algorithms for manipulating polynomials can often be used to solve the problem more efficiently. In contrast, if one can show that a task cannot be captured by simple polynomials, this can often be used to prove complexity-theoretic lower bounds. Matrix rigidity. Some of the most important and applicable algorithms are for computing linear transforms such as Fourier transforms. Matrix rigidity is a powerful but poorly understood tool for understanding their complexity. A matrix is called rigid if it cannot be decomposed as the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. It remains an open problem to prove that any explicit family of matrices is rigid. Matrix multiplication algorithms. Matrix multiplication is prevalent in computational science and is known to be equivalent to many other computational problems in linear algebra. We will see how fast matrix multiplication algorithms are designed, including some recent developments. Evaluation will be primarily based on a final project. I will provide a list of suggestions for the project, but students are encouraged to relate their project to their interests.

HPC is where cutting edge technology (GPUs, low latency interconnects, etc.) is applied to the solution of scientific and data-driven problems. One of the key ingredients to the current success of ML is the ability to perform computations on very large amounts of training data. Today, the application of HPC techniques to ML algorithms is a fundamental driver for the progress of Artificial Intelligence. In this course, you will learn HPC techniques that are typically applied to supercomputing software, and how they are applied to obtain the maximum performance out of ML algorithms. You will also learn about techniques for building efficient ML systems. The course is based on PyTorch, CUDA programming, MPI.

COMS 6998 Internet Measurement (syllabus, COMS, ELEN) | Ethan Katz-Bassett In this course, we will investigate important problems, techniques, results, and challenges that arise in measuring the Internet. We will explore both what measurements tell us about the Internet and how we can leverage what they tell us to improve the Internet and services that run on it. We will learn to measure various aspects of the Internet, including topology, routing and routing policies, performance, failures, traffic, and applications. Researchers often talk about Internet measurement as being analogous to astronomy, in that we take observations from afar in order to understand how a system works. The class will be discussion-based. Students will conduct small research projects in groups — in past offerings of this course, most students published their projects in peer-reviewed venues. COMS 6998 MACHINE LEARNING & CLIMATE | Kucukelbir, Alp In this course, we will study two aspects of how ml interacts with Earth’s climate. First, we will investigate how ml can be used to tackle climate change. We will focus on use cases from transportation, manufacturing, food and agriculture, waste management, and atmospheric studies.

By the end of this course, you will learn about modern statistical and causal ml methods and their applications to the climate. Our focus will be the modeling of real-world phenomena using probability models, with a focus on vision, time series forecasting, uncertainty quantification, and causality. In addition, you will gain a deeper understanding about the carbon footprint of ml itself and explore how to mitigate it. COMS 6998 NATURAL LANG GEN SUMMARIZ | McKeown, Kathleen There has been tremendous progress recently in the development of models to generate language for different purposes and to produce summaries of input documents. This success has largely come about due to rapid advances in large language models. In this class, we will explore four main topics: language generation, multimodal generation, summarization and long-format question answering. We will study large language models that have been used for these different tasks and issues that arise. For example, how possible is to control the output of these large language models along different dimensions? How do we evaluate the textual output of such systems?

COMS 6998 Proof Complexity and Applications | Toniann Pitassi Prerequisites : This is an advanced topics class in theoretical computer science, but it is open to everyone. The most important prerequisite is mathematical maturity (comfort with understanding and writing mathematical proofs). Students should also be very comfortable with algorithmic concepts, basic complexity theory, and proofs. Course Description Proof complexity studies the following question: Given a true mathematical statement, what is the length of the shortest proof ththe statement is true? Proof complexity is fundamentally connected both to major open questions of computational complexity theory and to practical properties of automated theorem provers and reasoning systems. Moreover, new connections between proof complexity and circuit complexity have been uncovered, and the interplay between these two areas has become quite rich. In addition, concepts and techniques in proof complexity have borrowed from and contributed to several other areas of computer science, including: crytography, automated reasoning and AI, complexity of search classes within NP, the analysis of heuristics and algorithms for NP-hard problems, and bounded arithmetic. Moreover in the last ten years, enormous progress has been made in proof complexity, with many open problems resolved, and many promising directions to attack other problems. For example, recent work (that we will cover) uses proof complexity to achieve breakthrough lower bounds on locally decodable codes, as well as the development of algorithms for a variety of distributional learning problems through the “Sum-of-Squares” paradigm. This course is intended to serve as an introduction to modern proof complexity, emphasizing its connections with computational complexity and algorithms in optimization. We will cover the fundamentals of propositional proof complexity, starting with the study of the important proof systems that occur both in theory and practice. We will survey state-of-the-art lower bound techniques in proof complexity for a variety of proof systems, including algebraic and semi-algebraic systems.

COMS 6998 QUANTUM COMPLEXITY CRYPTO | Yuen, Henry Course Website This is an advanced, PhD-level topics class in the theory of quantum computing, focusing in particular on cutting-edge topics in quantum complexity theory and quantum cryptography. The theme of the topics this year will be Complexity of quantum states and state transformations. An n-qubit quantum state appears to be exponentially more complex than an n-bit string; a classical description of such a state requires writing down 2n complex amplitudes in general. Here are some questions that will motivate our explorations: How does this complexity manifest itself in different information-processing tasks? How can we quantify this complexity? Can this complexity be used for cryptographic applications? Does the complexity of quantum states relate to traditional concepts in complexity theory such as circuit complexity or space complexity or time complexity? A list of possible topics: Shadow tomography of quantum states Quantum state synthesis/unitary synthesis Hamiltonian learning Quantum key distribution/quantum money QMA(2) and the power of un entanglement State complexity, AdS/CFT, and quantum gravity Quantum state complexity and statistical zero knowledge Pseudorandom states and unitaries Classical vs. quantum proofs The following notes from Scott Aaronson will be frequently consulted: https://www.scottaaronson.com/barbados-2016.pdf . The goal is to explore the results and (more importantly) the questions in this field. Course work may include: scribe notes, a few assignments, and a course project. Prerequisites Must have taken: Basic linear algebra and basic probability theory. You must have taken at least one of: An upper-level CS theory course such as complexity theory/cryptography/algorithms, or Quantum computing, or Quantum physics. It is not required that you have taken a course in quantum computing/quantum information before, but it would definitely be helpful.

COMS 6998 READINGS LANGUAGE DESIGN | Bjarne Stroustrup This course involves reading, presenting, and discussing papers on programming language design. In the first lecture, I outline some dimensions of language design and give examples of aims and ideals that have driven the development of languages. I also present a (necessarily incomplete) list of classical design papers. In the second lecture, I present a paper for discussion to give an idea of how that may be done. This is not a comparative languages class nor a type-theory class. The focus on presentations should be on ideals, aims, and principles so that language features are presented simply as examples. For older languages it is possible and desirable to discuss how the ideas worked out in actual use and evolved. Uncritical “sales jobs” of languages – as are not uncommon in early descriptions of new languages – are not acceptable as presentations. You might, of course, choose to present your favorite language, but maintain a critical and objective perspective. COMS 6998 REPRESENTATION LEARNING | Vondrick, Carl The course will discuss the latest research in representation learning. Each week, we will discuss a topic by reading papers in computer vision, NLP, machine learning, and robotics. Attendance is required and every student will be expected to speak during each class.

These advances have led to widespread adoption and deployment of ML in security- and safety-critical systems such as self-driving cars, malware detection, and aircraft collision avoidance systems. This wide adoption of DL techniques presents new challenges as the predictability and correctness of such systems are of crucial importance. Unfortunately, ML systems, despite their impressive capabilities, often demonstrate unexpected or incorrect behaviors in corner cases for several reasons such as biased training data, overfitting, and underfitting of the models. In safety- and security-critical settings, such incorrect behaviors can lead to disastrous consequences such as a fatal collision of a self-driving car. For example, a Google self-driving car recently crashed into a bus because it expected the bus to yield under a set of rare conditions but the bus did not. A Tesla car in autopilot crashed into a trailer because the autopilot system failed to recognize the trailer as an obstacle due to its “white color against a brightly lit sky” and the “high ride height.” Such corner cases were not part of Google’s or Tesla’s test set and thus never showed up during testing. Other examples include Microsoft’s Tay chatbot tweeting racist words because it was misled by malicious twitter users, and Google removing “gorilla” as an image class after its image classification algorithm incorrectly classified dark skined people as gorillas. These challenges have drawn huge attention from researchers in machine learning, security, systems, and programming language communities. A number of techniques and theories have been proposed to increase the robustness and security of machine learning. In this course, we will study the most practical and most important of these techniques and theories with a focus on deep learning.

COMS 6998: Topics in Mobile X | Xia Zhou Prerequisites: Because this is a high-level course, we assume that students already have a solid understanding of the basics of some areas, including networking, communication, and machine learning. There are multiple ways of demonstrating a networking and machine learning background, including taking undergraduate networking classes, machine learning classes, or equivalent classes, and experiences of working on related projects. The course project is an important part of this class. Students must have good programming skills and project experience. Abstract: Topics in Mobile X is an upper-level course on mobile computing and ubiquitous systems, covering a broad range of advanced and interdisciplinary topics in mobile computing, networking, and applications. All these topics center on unique challenges faced on bringing computation, networking, and applications to the mobile computing platform — a platform that is constrained in form factor, energy, and computation power, with examples such as smartphones, smart watches or wrist bands, smart glasses, and more. Example topics include mobile communication and networking, mobile sensing, mobile human-to-computer interaction (HCI), mobile learning/AI, and mobile security. For each topic, we will study both conventional perspectives and recent research trends. Students will learn key principles in mobile computing research, understand the state of the art in this research area, and gain experience of carrying out original research through class projects. The end goal is to generate publishable results by the end of the term. In addition, students will practice their skills in paper reading/writing and public presentation in the form of weekly research essays, class discussions, paper critiques, project reports and presentations.

COMS 6998: Unconditional Lower Bounds and Derandomization | Rocco Servedio Prerequisites : The most important prerequisite is “mathematical maturity”; you should be comfortable with proofs, basic discrete math, combinatorics, probability, and linear algebra. If you have questions about your mathematical readiness you should contact the instructor before enrolling. COMS 4236 (Introduction to Computational Complexity) is good preparation, but this is not required. The course will not include any programming. Description : This is a course about unconditional lower bounds and complexity-theoretic pseudorandom generators for restricted models of computation. We will study many unconditional lower bounds and derandomization results for interesting and important models of computation, covering various “gens” of the field that have been discovered over the past few decades. There will be an emphasis on techniques and we will highlight many open questions along the way. http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rocco/Teaching/S24/ COMS 6998 VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY | Feiner, Steven This course will cover selected topics in VR and AR.

Each of you will be individually responsible for reading and commenting on all the papers and for participating in a team presentation of a selected set of papers related to one theme. Projects: You will be developing a project in a small (individual or 2-3 person) team using the Unity 3D development environment. Projects will use either headset-based VR or phone-based AR. Through the generosity of a Provost Emerging Technology Grant, I expect to lend an Oculus Quest to each of you doing a headset-based VR project. Thus, members of all team projects can work remotely from each other without needing to share equipment. While you can generate your own project idea, I will encourage you to choose from a collection of projects co-advised with faculty and students in other schools, ranging from Medicine and Dentistry, to Social Work. Prerequisites: You will ideally have taken COMS W4172 (3D User Interfaces and Augmented Reality) or equivalent and be comfortable with developing in Unity. However, I am willing to admit students who don’t have this background, with the understanding that you will need to get up to speed with Unity, starting early in September. Please fill out the survey linked to the course SSOL entry, which is a necessary precondition to being admitted to the course.

The more drivers identified, the more options to treat the cancer with a drug known to act on that gene. But identifying a specific driver is not easy, especially when entire sections of the chromosome are damaged. Traditional biological tools, slow and imprecise, have identified only a limited number. As cancer \"big data\" accumulates, researchers are turning to computational methods, specifically machine learning, to identify additional drivers. But it's not immediately clear how to apply these methods to genetic data. Machine learning expects a lot of data, but biological data is relatively sparse compared to other application domains in machine learning. In a paper published last November in Cell , Felix Sanchez-Garcia , a computer science PhD student, describes a new algorithm that integrates data from multiple diverse sources, using the strong features in one to bolster weaker evidence in the other. Applied to breast cancer patients, the algorithm doubled the number of identified driver genes. Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and no two cancers are the same even when they occur at the same tissue of origin. Each cancer type—breast, lung melanoma, ovarian—falls into differing subtypes, and each subtype can be further divided; even within",

Applied to breast cancer patients, the algorithm doubled the number of identified driver genes. Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and no two cancers are the same even when they occur at the same tissue of origin. Each cancer type—breast, lung melanoma, ovarian—falls into differing subtypes, and each subtype can be further divided; even within a subtype, each individual cancer is unique. This multiplicity of cancers has long been an obstacle to successful treatments. But at their core, all cancers have this similarity: a gene in some region of the chromosome has mutated and is causing the cell to malfunction and divide uncontrollably. This basic understanding of cancer and the role of genes, long ago identified by biologists and geneticists, shows the complexity of cancer but also suggests a path forward. Find the gene causing the cancer, called a driver gene, then find a drug that works on that gene to inhibit its cancer-causing properties. (At least five different drugs target the Bcr-Abl mutation for example.) Identifying a driver gene is not easy. Cancer cells are undergoing incredibly rapid mutation and evolution, and are compromised in regards to the body's normally robust DNA repair mechanisms. Cancer cells have so much wrong with them that their entire DNA integrity and error correction is out of whack, resulting in the accumulation of multiple spurious mutations. Often entire sections of the chromosome are damaged; the difficulty is in zeroing in on the specific region likely to harbor a driver gene and then isolating the specific driver from surrounding mutated genes that don't contribute to the cancer, the passenger genes. Dana Pe'er , whose lab is working to apply computational methods to systems biology, likens hunting for a driver gene to investigating a plane crash. How is it possible, amidst the distributed wreckage, to find the one screw that failed? New tools needed For many years, tracking down the gene responsible was done in the lab using traditional bench biology tools to physically examine cells at the molecular level.

Such methods are slow and lack the power and precision to identify weak and rare drivers. Biologists using traditional lab methods have identified only a limited of drivers. As more cancer data accumulates, researchers are looking at computational methods. Classifying driver and passenger genes should be a classic machine-learning problem: Apply a supervised machine-learning approach to \"learn\" the features—attributes that are meaningful for a particular problem—that distinguish known driver genes and apply that method to identify other, still-unknown drivers. It's a concept that rests on a solid statistical foundation and is being used successfully in other areas of everyday life to predict customer buying patterns and behavior, to detect fraud, and to recognize speech and handwriting. The idea of applying machine-learning and other statistical methods to cancer research is not new. But the complexity of the biology relative to the abundance of data presents an obstacle. The traditional statistical methods at the heart of machine learning assume the number of samples is much larger than the number of features or parameters, an assumption that is not true in biology and cancer research. Tumor cohorts (a form of longitudinal study) typically number in the hundreds, while the number of potential drivers number in the tens of thousands. What is more, biology and cancer research also entail an extraordinarily large number of features; in the case of cancer there may be tens of thousands of features, many of which are expressions levels (genes can be expressed as either RNA or a protein product, with the level or amount of expression being highly informative). Tens of thousands of genes' expressions are observed in a small number (hundreds to thousands) of samples. Not all features are equal of course, and for each problem the set of meaningful features is different. One challenge in genomics is making the problem manageable by imposing constraints and honing in on those features—out of tens of thousands—that matter most.",

One challenge in genomics is making the problem manageable by imposing constraints and honing in on those features—out of tens of thousands—that matter most. It's a problem of feature selection, and for distinguishing driver from passenger genes, it requires both a strong understanding of machine learning methods and a deep appreciation of cancer biology and genomics. A computer scientist learns biology Felix Sanchez-Garcia began his graduate studies in 2008 in the Department of Computer Science, pursuing a master's degree in machine learning. During his last semester, he began working in Dana Pe'er's lab to provide statistical validation and support. At the time, he had little knowledge of biological sciences, but quickly got up to speed on the basics while working in the lab. After completing his master's, he went on to pursue doctoral studies at Columbia, continuing to work in the Pe'er Lab while taking classes in molecular biology, cellular biology, cancer biology, and related topics. As he gained a firm foundation of biological knowledge, he was in an excellent position to apply his machine learning expertise to biological problems, choosing for his PhD thesis the project of identifying additional drivers in breast cancer. Breast cancers like many other cancers are the result of what is called a somatic copy number alteration (SCNA), which is a deletion or duplication of DNA within certain regions of the genome. SCNAs usually include tens of genes (as opposed to point mutations, which map to a single nucleotide pair in the DNA). In an SCNA, DNA might be deleted or duplicated within certain regions of the chromosome. The marked region on the left is duplicated in the chromosome to the right. Such alterations to the DNA may or may not lead to cancer. SCNAs are thought to recurrently affect close to 140 regions of the genome; almost every cancer genome will harbor a few. Not all SCNAs are harmful or significant. Many are simply random background alterations that",

For identifying significant SCNAs, there are existing algorithms but most lack the necessary resolution to identify driver regions small enough so it becomes possible to identify the single gene responsible for a cancer. Nor do SCNA-detection algorithms take into account that the alteration rate can differ greatly among different genomic regions; most (including GISTIC2) compute a null distribution across the entire genome to estimate the significance of alterations, meaning each region is independently evaluated against a global absolute. Sanchez-Garcia suspected some regions might not score highly against the global absolute score but would nevertheless be significantly more altered than adjacent chromosomal regions. With help from Dylan Kotliar, Bo Juen Chen, and Uri David Akavia—all in the Pe'er Lab—he created a new algorithm called ISAR (Identification of Significantly Altered Regions) specifically to compare an alteration only with nearby, surrounding alterations. This measure of local alteration became an additional data point for identifying possible regions harboring driver genes. Applying this methodology to 785 breast cancer tumor samples (taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas , or TCGA), ISAR identified 83 significant regions, more than double the 30 regions previously reported. Those regions found by ISAR included previously known regions as well as additional ones, including several containing known oncogenes (genes having the potential to cause cancer), thus providing strong evidence that the algorithm was making accurate predictions. Looking to the data With ISAR supplying a list of regions likely to harbor driver genes, Sanchez-Garcia and Pe'er then moved to the next step: identifying driver genes within those regions. Standard classification approaches rely on an initial list of sample drivers and passengers to train the model. The problem here is that the list of known drivers is relatively small and strongly biased also (toward kinases and extreme phenotypes). Sanchez-Garcia opted",

Standard classification approaches rely on an initial list of sample drivers and passengers to train the model. The problem here is that the list of known drivers is relatively small and strongly biased also (toward kinases and extreme phenotypes). Sanchez-Garcia opted for a different approach, one that would look to the data itself to determine significant features. This more data-centric approach of course works best when data is plentiful, which is not the case for any single cancer data source. The solution was to incorporate different data sources, measuring different aspects of each cancer to obtain a range of different data types. One data source was the primary tumor data, which is measured directly from patient tumors. From this data source Sanchez-Garcia obtained copy number, point mutations, and gene expression levels. A second data source was from cell lines, which is data originally derived from tumors but modified for lab study. For cell lines, he derived copy number, gene expression levels, and functional RNAi screening data, which provides functional information about the genome by knocking out each individual gene in a cell line. Together this diverse set of data produced a single candidate driver score. While previous methods had also integrated different data sources, particularly patient data and functional lab cell line, they tended to look for intersection between data sources, in effect narrowing the data by omitting non-overlapping data. Wanting to use more not less data, Sanchez-Garcia and Pe'er designed a new driver-detection algorithm called Helios with the aim of integrating the data sources in a more intelligent, complementary way. It was here Sanchez-Garcia's machine-learning expertise came most prominently into play. Using the technique of transfer learning —where information learned in one task is applied to another—Sanchez-Garcia initiates Helios with a small number of likely drivers, specifically those nearest the most frequently altered segment of an ISAR-identified region. Taking an unbiased approach, Helios learns the features of these strong drivers, and then looks for complementary patterns from the additional genetic and genomic data to discover additional features.

Taking an unbiased approach, Helios learns the features of these strong drivers, and then looks for complementary patterns from the additional genetic and genomic data to discover additional features. If evidence for a feature in one data source is weak, it may be stronger in another. In this way, drivers with clearer signal help learn features to improve performance in cases with less obvious signal. Together the different features identify drivers that one feature by itself could not. It's an iterative approach where the algorithm is run multiple times. The first iteration picks up the strongest signals, and this information gets incorporated into the next iteration. Each iteration thus incorporates the new information the model learned in the previous iteration to pick up additional signal. Each subsequent iteration works off slightly more refined information than did the previous iteration. Helios keeps iterating through the data, producing drivers with a weaker but still distinct signal until there is no more signal to be found. It is a statistically rigorous framework for combining multiple signals that might lack power individually. At the end, Helios produces a list of candidate drivers, ranked according to the probability each is a true cancer driver. Shockingly accurate results Validation was systematic and comprehensive. The researchers simply let the algorithm run to see what drivers it could discover. Of all predictions, researchers took the top scoring 17 for validation. In seven of the 17 regions, the top Helios-identified gene was a bona-fide breast cancer oncogene (ERBB2, CCND1, ZNF217, Myc, miR-21, FGFR2, and IGF1R). Each scored well above the next best scoring gene. Myc's Helios score, for example, was 100 times greater than the second best gene in the region. In the additional 10 regions, there was no known breast cancer driver so in each case researchers performed in vitro validation, finding that 10 of the 12 candidates selected in those 10 regions (in two regions, there were two equally scoring genes and both were selected for validation) provided a",

Reflecting on these results, Dr. Pe'er explains, \"This is the first and largest scale systematic validation undertaken for an algorithm of this type, and its accuracy is unprecedented. Its ability to reveal so many new cancer drivers is due to the fact that our hypotheses were generated in an unsupervised way using statistical criteria, rather than by cherry-picking our candidates based on prior biological knowledge. The experimental results show that Helios is a very robust algorithm that can generate biological insights that would be extremely difficult to produce in any other way.\" With ISAR selecting regions and Helios pinpointing the most likely driver within each region, Sanchez-Garcia and Pe'er were able to double the number of drivers implicated in breast cancer. The number of high-frequency drivers (seen in >5% patients, the ones that are more likely to be followed up with drug development), increased from 15 to 29. The accurate results demonstrated by Helios hold out hope for more effective and personalized treatments for breast cancer and suggest which drugs should be developed. It is only the first step. The next step, already begun, will be to design therapies for patients. The success of Helios demonstrates the validity of statistical modeling and other computational methods in discovering and treating disease through pure analysis of the data alone. Except for validating results in the lab, researchers worked only with data. It is an approach not limited to breast cancer. In the same way Helios learns the weight of each feature directly from diverse breast-cancer data, it can do the same for other cancers.
