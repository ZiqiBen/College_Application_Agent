At the start of the program, you'll meet with an academic advisor to develop a plan of study , which is submitted to and approved by an MEM director during the first term of residence. Learning Outcomes MEM students have a demonstrated ability to become leaders in both the engineering and business aspects of technology. The MEM curriculum integrates engineering, mathematics, and core management courses, with elective courses drawing from engineering and management. Many students focus their electives in Data Analytics, Product Management, or Entrepreneurship. MEM students gain the ability to solve complex engineering problems by using advanced engineering methods and techniques. MEM students learn to define problems, analyze data, and design solutions while considering technical, economic, and/or societal requirements/impacts. Required Coursework The MEM program requires the completion of 14 courses, including the capstone project course (ENGG 390), although the actual number of courses may vary from student to student, depending on their preparation and coursework before entering the program.",

Many students focus their electives in Data Analytics, Product Management, or Entrepreneurship. MEM students gain the ability to solve complex engineering problems by using advanced engineering methods and techniques. MEM students learn to define problems, analyze data, and design solutions while considering technical, economic, and/or societal requirements/impacts. Required Coursework The MEM program requires the completion of 14 courses, including the capstone project course (ENGG 390), although the actual number of courses may vary from student to student, depending on their preparation and coursework before entering the program.

Tuck full-term electives are 1 credit, half-term \"minis\" are 0.5 credits. Capstone Project (ENGG 390) In addition to coursework, MEM students take part in a capstone project, typically in the form of an industry internship, to satisfy the ENGG 390: Master of Engineering Management Project requirement, usually during the summer term following their first year. The capstone project typically focuses on both engineering and business practices. The project should define a practical need, conceive and evaluate potential solutions, describe appropriate analytical, experimental, and economic evaluations, and provide recommendations for further action. Students must enroll for ENGG 390 during the same term as their capstone project, and may not enroll in any other course while taking ENGG 390, without approval from an MEM director. MORE ABOUT MEM INTERNSHIPS Residency & Program Duration MEM students must be enrolled full-time and in residence for a minimum of three academic terms. Students typically complete the program over four terms (15 months) plus one summer capstone project, starting in September and finishing in late November at the end of the following Fall term. Deviations from the typical program timeline may occur for existing Dartmouth students who stay on to complete the MEM program. Sample Program Plan The MEM degree requires a total of 14 courses, with eight core courses and six electives. Students may choose from a variety of electives to support their academic and professional goals. The following program plan shows one possible way an MEM student could build their program of study, and can serve as a starting point for conversations with an MEM director who serves as their academic advisor. Standard Curriculum Sample Plan This sample plan illustrates a standard core course sequence for MEM students. Students work with an advisor to choose electives that closely match their academic and professional goals to customize their program of study.

Duke University Exchange Dartmouth MEM students may choose to spend their second fall term at Duke's MEM Program through the Duke University Exchange program. Dartmouth students interested in this program must request permission from an MEM Program Director by June 1 before their exchange term. Students must be enrolled in the Duke MEM program as an on-campus student (not online). Focus Areas Along with the flexibility to develop your own multi-disciplinary program of study, Dartmouth's MEM program also offers the option to take focused courses within one of three areas of technology leadership: data analytics, product management, or entrepreneurship. Data Analytics Courses in this focus area introduce concepts and methods behind business analytics, machine learning, and optimization modeling, with opportunities to work on a real-world industry project. Product Management Courses in this focus area teach planning, organizing, and resource management during a product’s life cycle, including a significant hand-on, product design and development project. Entrepreneurship Courses in this focus area provide essential tools for innovation and entrepreneurship, from patents to market research to funding and investors—key training to help you launch your own company or lead new ventures.

BE-MEM With advanced planning, students enrolled in Dartmouth’s Bachelor of Engineering (BE) program, including Partner School Dual-Degree students, are able to pursue both BE and MEM degrees simultaneously and complete them in a reduced timeframe. Students should consider applying to the MEM program during their senior year. Students may count ENGS 93: Statistical Methods in Engineering, even if it was taken as part of the AB and/or BE requirements, and may count up to two additional graduate-level electives toward the MEM degree, provided these additional electives were not taken to satisfy AB degree requirements. MEM-MEng Students may count up to three graduate-level electives towards both MEM and Master of Engineering (MEng) degrees and complete both degrees in as little as two years. MEM-MBA Tuck School of Business students interested in gaining the full range of both the management skills taught at Tuck and the technical skills taught at Thayer will benefit from this joint degree. This program is intended to develop leaders for careers that combine engineering, technology, and business management. Students must apply for and be admitted to both Tuck and Thayer and complete the admissions and financial aid processes for each school. It is recommended that students apply and enroll at Tuck first, then apply to Thayer during their first year of studies in Tuck's MBA program. Students who pursue the joint degree can complete the program in as little as 2.5 years (a total of eight terms, including the summer). Dartmouth BE-MEM Example The curriculum example below illustrates one potential pathway for Dartmouth BE students, including Partner School Dual Degree students, interested in simultaneously pursuing the MEM degree.
