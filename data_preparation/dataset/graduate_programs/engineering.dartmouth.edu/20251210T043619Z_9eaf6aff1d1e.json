Students may use up to six applicable graduate courses for both their BE and MS programs. Those courses must be beyond the requirements for the AB (typically in the fifth year) and students must have taken a substantial portion of the undergraduate program at Dartmouth or in one of its official exchange programs. Students should discuss their plans to satisfy both program requirements with the MS program director. At least one term prior to their thesis defense, the BE/ MS candidate submits to the registrar a BE program plan approved by both their advisor and the BE program director.\nFor available projects that can satisfy BE+MS degree requirements, see the\nMS projects list\n.\nMS+MD Degree Program\nDartmouth's\nMS+MD program\n, offered by Thayer and\nThe Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth\n, is designed for students intending to pursue clinical practice and want to develop research skills in a related\nengineering area\n. It is also well suited to students who want to better understand technologies they will employ as practicing physicians. The program provides a funded research experience in engineering that is expected to lead to a research publication and provides practice in engineering design and analysis.\nMEM+MS Degree Program\nStudents who want to qualify in both research and the practical application of engineering and management may earn the MS and the\nMaster of Engineering Management (MEM)\ndegrees simultaneously by completing all the requirements of both degrees. A separate application to the MEM program is required; the student should work out course choices and funding plans for each degree. Interested students should contact the\nMEM Director\n.\nTransition to a PhD Program\nHighly qualified students may be allowed to transition to a\nPhD degree program\nwith the approval of the Senior Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Programs and at the invitation of a willing faculty sponsor.\nPrerequisites\nMS candidates are required to hold a bachelor level degree in engineering or in one of the physical sciences from an accredited institution. Admitted students who require additional engineering coursework may be required to complete additional undergraduate engineering courses prior to beginning their MS studies.\nCourses & Requirements\nAll students entering the program are required to take six\ngraduate-level courses\n, beyond the AB degree, reflecting a distribution across applied math (one course), engineering depth (three courses), and engineering breadth (two courses). Students with prior graduate credits may transfer up to a maximum of three graduate course credits to count towards their required MS coursework, provided they were not used to satisfy bachelor's degree requirements. Dartmouth\nBachelor of Engineering\n(BE) students may count up to six applicable classes towards both the BE and Master of Science (MS) degrees.\nPlease note:\nThe information below reflects degree requirements, effective as of\nFall 2025\n.\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents will demonstrate their significant contribution to engineering knowledge and professional expertise in the chosen area of study by performing original research.\nStudents will acquire technical depth in their chosen area of concentration while also gaining a breadth of knowledge in related fields.\nStudents will acquire the ability to identify, specify, and formulate complex engineering problems beyond those typical of undergraduate academic training, and develop an ability to solve complex engineering problems by using advanced engineering methods and techniques.\nStudents will acquire an ability to assess the quality of solutions for complex engineering problems against technical, economic, and/or societal requirements/impacts.\nRequired Coursework\nCOURSE TYPE\nNUMBER OF REQUIRED COURSES\nCOURSES\nApplied Mathematics\n1 course\nChoose at least 1 course, from the following:\nENGS 91\n: Numerical Methods in Computation\nENGS 92\n: Fourier Transforms and Complex Variables\nENGS 93\nor\nENGG 193\n: Statistical Methods in Engineering\nENGS 100\n: Methods in Applied Mathematics I\nENGS 103\n: Operations Research\nENGS 104\n: Optimization Methods for Engineering Applications\nENGS 105\n: Computational Methods for Partial Differential Equations I\nENGG 107\n: Bayesian Statistical Modeling and Computation\nENGS 108\n: Applied Machine Learning\nENGS 200\n: Methods in Applied Mathematics II\nENGS 202\n: Nonlinear Systems\nENGS 205\n: Computational Methods for Partial Differential Equations II\nENGG 309\n: Topics in Computational Science\nEngineering Depth\n3 courses\nChoose at least 3 courses, from the following:\nCourses in the area of the student's research should be chosen to increase the student's depth of expertise and knowledge.

ENGS courses can be used for credit toward the AB degree and to satisfy requirements for the engineering sciences major. ENGG courses, which are generally graduate-level courses, may be used for credit toward the AB degree but do not satisfy requirements for the engineering sciences major. Undergraduate engineering courses are numbered 1 to 99, with upper-level courses requiring prerequisite coursework. Graduate engineering courses are numbered 100 to 200, and most have prerequisites or other minimum requirements. Courses numbered 300 and above are considered advanced graduate courses. Undergraduate engineering science majors may take graduate courses for which they are qualified. Not all graduate courses, however, can be used to satisfy the AB and/ or Engineering Sciences major requirements.
