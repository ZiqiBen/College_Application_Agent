Carnegie Mellon University's Master of Human-Computer Interaction degree is a rigorous, interdisciplinary program. The MHCI curriculum is strategically designed to teach core user-centered research, interaction design, user experience and interface programming skills while allowing students to customize their own HCI path with unique electives from across the university. Students enrolled in the MHCI program are required to take 7 core classes and 4 electives to complete their degree and graduate. Seven Core HCI Courses 1) 05-600: HCI Pro-Seminar: Communications in HCI This course has three objectives to strengthen HCI communication skills for work in industry: to expose students to the world of HCI through research and industry expert talks; to give students the opportunity to sharpen their English writing skills; And to introduce students to conflict management, teamwork and active listening skills in order to give them tools to collaborate more efficiently on multi-disciplinary teams. 2) 05-610: User-Centered Research and Evaluation (UCRE) This course provides an overview and introduction to the field of human-computer interaction. It introduces students to tools, techniques and sources of information about HCI and provides a systematic approach to design.

The course increases awareness of good and bad design through observation of existing technology, and teaches the basic skills of task analysis, and analytic and empirical evaluation methods. Graduate students will also participate in a laboratory where they will practice HCI techniques in an independent, self-defined project. 3) 05-660 Interaction Design Fundamentals * This studio course introduces students to design thinking and the basic practices of interaction design. It follows a human-centered design process that includes research, concept generation, prototyping, and refinement. Students must work effectively as individuals and in small teams to design mobile information systems and other interactive experiences. Assignments approach design on three levels: specific user interactions, contexts of use, and larger systems. Students will become familiar with design methodologies such as sketching, storyboarding, wire framing, prototyping, etc. No coding is required. This course serves as a prerequisite for Advanced Interaction Design (05-661). *May be placed out of, and another course substituted for the requirement 4) 05-661: Advanced Interaction Design ** This course follows 05-660: Interaction Design Fundamentals, and students are expected to apply what they have learned about design thinking and methodologies as a starting point for all assignments. Students will work in teams to perform guerrilla research, synthesize data, and consider the needs of multiple stakeholders in their design of mobile services and other intelligent systems. Design concepts go beyond user inter faces to include sensors, controls, and ubiquitous computing. Emphasis is placed on the quality of the students’ ideas and their ability to give form to their design concepts. By completing and presenting their work, students will gain skills related to professional UX design practice. **Depending on placement, this or another HCI design course may be used for the 2nd design course requirement 5) Choice: 05-635 or 05-631 05-635: Programming Interactive Experiences (PIX) PIX is an introductory course on designing, implementing, and evaluating computational interactions, such as web sites, apps, kiosks, and interactive installations.

Through a substantial team project, students apply classroom knowledge in analysis and evaluation, implementation and design, and develop skills working in multidisciplinary teams. The project begins in the spring semester before graduation and continues full-time through the final summer semester; it must be taken in consecutive spring and summer semesters.

Our Student Outcomes Since its founding, our program has graduated more than 1,000 students. The in-depth interdisciplinary experiences here at Carnegie Mellon make our students the glue between design, development and management in many companies. The MHCI student is often hired to play one role, but quickly becomes an indispensable team player — in many cases, a team leader for research, design and strategy in software, technical or consulting engagements.

Requirements encourage researchers to gain skill in a range of methodologies to support research that is both rigorous and creative. To this end, research is prioritized over any specific set of required courses, which we leave flexible to suit your individual interests. We expect that all students will become involved in an HCI research project from the beginning. For this we rely on an apprenticeship-based approach. You will be teamed early with an advisor who is matched to your interests, and who will guide you in your work. Communication Skill Requirement Students are required to make an oral presentation of their research work at the end of their first and second years of study. This encourages students to get started with research early and affords the opportunity to get research feedback early. Oral presentations are to the whole HCII community. A requirement for the Ph.D. is a “certification of communication skill,” which is awarded based on review and approval of presentations by the HCII faculty. Course Work The HCI Ph.D. program of study focuses on an emphasis area that students and advisors define together, which results in a coherent set of courses that enable the development of deeper knowledge in an area of interest, for example, Social Computing, Assistive Technologies, or Research through Design. A small set of core courses provide both a common experience for incoming students and a grounding in the concepts, methodologies, and prior work of a set of fields that contribute in important ways to HCI. Course requirements are structured to be completed within the first two and a half years of study. However, students are free to schedule their course work in a variety of ways to accommodate their educational needs. In some cases prerequisite course work may be needed or requirements may be waived. Course Requirements for All",

However, students are free to schedule their course work in a variety of ways to accommodate their educational needs. In some cases prerequisite course work may be needed or requirements may be waived. Course Requirements for All Students All programs of study are created individually, but must be approved in advance by both the student’s advisor and the faculty. All programs of study must include the following: 05-771: HCI Process and Theory Four graduate-level mini courses 05-772: Social Perspectives in HCI 05-773: Computer Science Perspectives in HCI 05-774: Design Perspectives in HCI 05-775: Cognitive Perspectives in HCI Four graduate-level courses in one of following three areas: behavioral, design, or technical. Additionally, at least one graduate-level course in each of the other two areas. At least one graduate-level design studio course Teaching Requirement Students must successfully complete two Teaching Assistantships (TAships). Successful completion is determined by the faculty member for whom the student serves as TA. Students are assigned to TAships by faculty and student representatives, in a process that is responsive to the department’s needs, student preferences, and faculty requests. Practice in HCI (Usability Skills) Requirement The intent of this requirement is for the student to demonstrate that they possess basic usability skills (which would, for example, enable the student to teach an Introductory HCI course). A couple of ways to fulfill this requirement is to either successfully take a course on usability methods or to complete a TAship for this course. To fulfill the Practice in HCI (Usability) requirement, you can TA for UCRE (User-Centered Research and Evaluation), SSUI (Software Structures for Usable Interfaces), or you can enroll in and receive at least a B- for the final grade in UCRE or SSUI . Dissertation Proposal and Defense Your program of study will culminate in a dissertation describing original research. Proposal and defense of this dissertation are primary requirements for obtaining a Ph.D. in HCI. Prior to proposing a dissertation topic, each student will form a Ph.D. committee consisting of an advisor, at least two but",

Proposal and defense of this dissertation are primary requirements for obtaining a Ph.D. in HCI. Prior to proposing a dissertation topic, each student will form a Ph.D. committee consisting of an advisor, at least two but as many as three HCII faculty members and one outside faculty member (taken from either another CMU department or from outside the University). This committee will be responsible for approving a written and oral presentation of a dissertation proposal, as well as the final written dissertation, and its oral defense.
