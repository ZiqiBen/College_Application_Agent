Learn More Overview Transfer Credits and Course Waivers Transferring Credit The MEM program recognizes that unexpected job transfers or career changes often necessitate terminating degree programs prior to the granting of a degree. For this reason, MEM allows limited transfer credit for up to 3 courses taken in a graduate program where a degree was not obtained. Applicants who think they may be eligible for transfer credit or course waiver should submit their request along with course description or syllabus at the time they submit their application. Course Waivers Waivers can be given for a required course when a student has already taken a comparable graduate level course. A waiver does not reduce the number of courses that the student takes, it simply waives that particular course. Occasionally, if a student has sufficient working knowledge of a subject, he can request a waiver exam. Undergraduate courses are not adequate preparation for these waivers. Applicants who think they may be eligible for a course waiver should submit their request along with course description or syllabus at the time they submit their application.

Program courses develop core management skills while staying on the cutting edge of technology. Curriculum The strength of the MEM Program is its multidisciplinary approach, combining core business principles with graduate level engineering education. Students learn the basics of management, quantitative analysis, and behavioral science and choose advanced engineering electives in their area of specialization. An MEM degree can be a differentiator as students learn the fundamentals of business while relying on a base of engineering knowledge. This specialized approach allows for a unique experience that stands apart from that of an MBA. “We focus on students who want to leverage their technical background. They think of themselves as engineers, and they want to continue in STEM. Among the top-performing CEOs in the world, a majority hold degrees particular to their industries. MEM gives students an alternative path to an MBA, one that may be better suited for their career goals and interests.” - Mark Werwath, MEM Program Director Degree Requirements A minimum number of 12 courses is required to earn the Master of Engineering Management degree. Among them are: Core Courses (7 Courses) MEM 402: Engineering Management MEM 403: Accounting for Engineers MEM 404: Financial Issues for Engineers MEM 405: Marketing Issues for Engineers MEM 407: Decision Tools for Managers MEM 424: Leadership and Organizational Behavior Choose one (1) of the following Capstone courses: MEM 436: Technology Strategy for Products (offered in Fall) MEM 437: Strategic Management for Engineers (offered in",

Curriculum Academic Standards & Integrity Academic integrity is fundamental to every facet of the scholarly process and is expected of every student in the Master of Engineering Management program in all academic undertakings. Integrity includes strict adherence to academic honesty, and to ethical conduct consistent with standards that respect the intellectual efforts of both oneself and others. Ensuring integrity in academic work is a joint enterprise involving both faculty and students. Among the most important goals of graduate education are maintaining an environment of academic integrity and instilling in students a lifelong commitment to the academic honesty that is fundamental to good scholarship. These goals are best achieved as a result of effective dialogue between students and faculty mentors regarding academic integrity, and by the examples of members of the academic community whose intellectual accomplishments demonstrate sensitivity to the nuances of ethical conduct in scholarly work. Standards of academic honesty are violated whenever a student engages in any action that jeopardizes the integrity of scholarly work. Such actions include: Cheating in the classroom or on examinations The intentional and deliberate misuse of data in order to draw conclusions that may not be warranted by the evidence Fabrication of data Omission or concealment of conflicting data for the purpose of misleading others Use of another's words, ideas or, creative productions without citation Paraphrasing or summarizing another's material in such a way as to misrepresent the author's intentions Use of privileged material or unpublished work without permission Students and faculty are guided in matters of academic integrity at the University, The Graduate School, and the",

McCormick’s procedures, described here , operate within the broader Northwestern policy framework detailed in the document Academic Integrity, A Basic Guide , available on the Provost’s website. Academic dishonesty is a serious matter, and it will be adjudicated in accordance with procedures approved by the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and, if applicable, The Graduate School . MEM Student Policies The Master of Engineering Management Student Policies Handbook Document has been created specifically for MEM students to understand degree requirements, policies and procedures, and academic information to ensure successful completion of the MEM degree at Northwestern University. In addition, Northwestern strives to create an environment that fosters innovation, excellence, and collaboration, seeking always to do so responsibly, ethically, and with integrity. To this end, we must have in place thoughtful, strategic guidelines and policies that promote the success of our students, faculty, and staff in their daily work. Our University policies thus are meant to guide and enable our community members to uphold Northwestern’s values and expectations. We encourage all community members to use the Northwestern University Policies website as the main source for University -wide policies, as it will feature the most current information and updates on all policy-related items. MEM Course Auditing Policy Course auditors are not given formal recognition or academic credits by either the MEM Program or the Registrar. An MEM student in good standing is permitted to audit an MEM course, without formal registration, depending on the limitations of space and facilities, permission of the instructor, and approval by the MEM Program.
