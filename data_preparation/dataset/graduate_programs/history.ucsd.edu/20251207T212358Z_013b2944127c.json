There is no minimum GRE score required.\nIs the subject Graduate Record Examination (GRE) required?\nNo, we do not require the subject GRE.\nWhat is a competitive GRE score?\nThe average scores for the GRE General Test\nis\naround 157 Verbal, 151 Quantitative, 4 Analytical.

The statement should be limited to 2500 words, well organized, concise, and completely free of grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors and must be submitted via the online application. Before submitting the statement, seek constructive comments and criticism from friends and advisors.\nFive primary topics to cover in your statement of purpose:\nHow did you become interested in this field? Establish that you have had a long-term interest in the field and that you have taken positive steps in pursuing your interest. Give the committee members a sense of your particular talents and abilities and their relevance to your academic interests.\nWhat experiences have contributed toward your preparation for further study in this field? Demonstrate your interest by providing examples of research experiences, internships, work experience, community service, publications, or life experiences. Briefly describe what you did in each experience. Also, make sure to articulate what you have learned about the field and how those lessons stimulated you to pursue an advanced degree.\nWhat are your future goals? Specifically, state your degree objective (Master's or Ph.D.) and specify what subdisciplines you are interested in pursuing. The committee needs to know your regional (ie., U.S., Europe, Latin America, East Asia, Africa, etc.) and topical focus (ie., legal history, cultural history, transnational history, gender studies in history, comparative racial and ethnic histories, etc.). Let the reader know that you are planning a future career as a university professor, researcher, consultant...or whatever your goal happens to be.\nWhat are your research interests? Within your subdiscipline, you should be able to identify one or two topics that are of interest to you. When possible, be specific about your research agenda. Remember that you will be working with professors in research; therefore, your research interests should parallel those of the faculty. (You will usually not be expected to know exactly what you want to research; faculty know that initial interests often change.)\nHow are you a \"match\" for the program to which you are applying? Explain what attracts you most to the institution/program to which you are applying. Align your research interests with those of one or more of the affiliated professors. The better the \"match\" with the program/professors, the better the chance that you will be admitted.\nOther factors to weave in (remember these are secondary factors):\nGive examples of personal attributes or qualities that would help you complete graduate study successfully.\nDescribe your determination to achieve your goals, your initiative and ability to develop ideas, and your ability to work independently.\nDescribe background characteristics that may have placed you at an educational disadvantage (English language learner, family economic history, lack of educational opportunity, disability, etc.).\nLeave the reader believing that you are prepared for advanced academic work and will be successful in graduate school.\nI have questions about the Language Proficiency Requirement (TOEFL, IELTS, etc)...\nUpdate:\nDuolingo English Test (DET) Now Accepted for Englist Language Proficiency\nBeginning with the Fall 2026 admission cycle, UC San Diego will accept the Duolingo English Test (DET) as one of the approved options for meeting the English language proficiency requirement for graduate admission. This is in addition to the existing TOEFL and IELTS options.\nWhat tests do you accept for language proficiency?\nThe Department of History accepts the DET, TOEFL and IELTS.\nWhat are the minimum scores the History Department will accept for language proficiency?\nThe Department of History accepts the minimum scores noted on the Division of Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs FAQ page for the\nTOEFL\nand\nIELTS\n. Further, for the purposes of employment, the Department of History requires minimum speaking sub scores of 23 for theTOEFL and 7 for the IELTS. Minimum total score for the DET is 120/160 and are vaild for two years from the date of the exam.\nUnder what circumstances am I exempt from the English Language Proficiency requirement?\nNon-native English language speakers may be exempt from this requirement if they have earned or will be earning a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree from either:\nA regionally accredited U.S. college or university where English is the sole language of instruction, or\nA foreign college or university which provides instruction solely in English. You may verify whether your institution meets this requirement by looking up your institution in the\nIAU World Higher Education Database (WHED)\n. If English is not the sole language of instruction listed, if no language is listed at all, or if the institution does not appear on the WHED website, you are required to submit English proficiency exam scores. No other documentation (e.g. letters, language certificates, school websites) may be used in place of WHED as a means to obtain an exemption from the English proficiency requirement.\nWill the department waive the English Language Proficiency requirement if I don't meet the criteria above?\nThe Department of History's PhD funding packages rely on a student's eligibility for\nAcademic Student Employment\n. International students who are not native English speakers must also meet the\nEnglish Language Requirement for International Teaching Assistants (TA)\nprior to\nworking as a TA in their second quarter in the program. We will not admit students whose scores do not meet the speaking sub-score threshold to sit the UC San Diego\nEnglish Language Certification Exam because there isn't enough time for the student to improve their scores in order to sit the exam.\nI have questions about the writing sample...\nWhat spacing should I use for my writing sample?\nOur faculty have a preference for double spacing.\nWhat font and size of font should I use for my writing sample?\nStandard fonts (Times New Roman, Cambria, Helvetica) in standard sizes (11-12 point).\nShould I include footnotes or works cited pages?\nYes. You should always include footnotes or works cited pages. This helps us assess you as a researcher.\nMy writing sample is longer than 15 pages--how should I edit it to meet the 7-15 page requirement?\nYou are welcome to submit a writing sample that is up to 30 pages.\nWhat sort of financial support is available?\nWhat financial support does the department offer MA students?\nWe do not offer financial support for MA students. However, MA students can apply for Teaching Assistantship positions or for Readerships. If MA students secure a 25% (or greater) Teaching Assistantship, or a 25% (or greater) Readership, they will be eligible for a fee remission for each quarter they work.\nWhat financial support does the department offer Ph.D. students?\nUpon the recommendation of the department, several types of financial support are available to graduate students: full or partial remission of fees and tuition, fellowships, research assistantships, teaching assistantships, readerships, and travel grants. Graduate students are eligible for one or a combination of these types of financial support. Offers of support are defined in each applicant's departmental offer letter.\nFor more student financial support visit the\nGrad Division website.\nHow do I get a Graduate Application fee waiver?\nThe fee waiver request is done online with the online graduate application. Only U.S. citizens and permanent residents may request a waiver of the application fee. Waivers are provided to applicants who are:\ncurrently receiving need-based financial assistance from an undergraduate or graduate institution; or\nclaiming financial hardship based on current federal tax return income data; or\nparticipating in selected federal or state-funded graduate school preparation programs.\nYou must have the name and email of the program director. All fee waivers are granted provisionally and applicants may be required to provide supporting documentation to finalize the waiver.\nAdditional Resources\nCampus Tours:\nhttp://admissions.ucsd.edu/visit/index.html\nCampus Map:\nhttps://maps.ucsd.edu/map/default.htm\nUC San Diego Catalog of Record:\nhttp://ucsd.edu/catalog/\nGraduate\nGraduate Admissions\nPh.D. Program\nMasters Program\nFunding\nEmployment\nPlacement\nNondiscrimination and Affirmative Action Policy",
