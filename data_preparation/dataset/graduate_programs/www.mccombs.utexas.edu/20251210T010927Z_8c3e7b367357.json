The risk management area considers hedging and risk management strategies.

Positions associated with brand and product management typically include profit and loss responsibilities for a product or product line along with a strong advocacy role for the long-term success of the brand. Opportunities for brand management expertise continue to expand as a growing number of companies and industries recognize their brands are often the most valuable assets that the company creates, markets, and manages. While pioneered within the consumer packaged goods industry, brand and product management has become a critical component of almost every company’s competitive strategy. Brand and product management jobs often entail running multi-million-dollar product businesses and hence provide excellent opportunities for those interested in general business and entrepreneurship. As brand management skills have become critical in the more central marketing strategy efforts of many leading organizations, brand management is increasingly a route to CEO positions.

In this regard, marketers’ greatest value lies in shaping the technological products produced by the firm into solutions that truly benefit potential customers and are differentiated from the rapidly proliferating competition. At the same time, high-technology marketers engage in the classic marketing activities of segmentation, targeting, positioning, and ongoing marketing support for the rest of the firm’s products. In some industries, high-technology marketing resembles consulting and some companies may have such internal consulting business units (3M, for example).

A minimum of two years of full-time work experience is strongly suggested to enter any of the dual degree programs. Students applying to a dual degree with no post-graduate full-time work experience are expected to recruit for internships and employment opportunities via the non-MBA side of their dual degree, as MBA recruiters expect at least three years of full-time work experience. Applicants who are not currently enrolled at a graduate program at UT Austin will begin their first year of study in the non-business side of the program, and do not begin MBA courses until year two. E nrolled UT Austin students who have completed the first year of studies in the non-business side will begin the MBA portion of the dual degree program in the fall. MBA/Doctor of Jurisprudence dual degree applicants must pay both the MBA application and the LSAC application fees. Applicants to other Dual Degree programs are required to only pay one application fee. The fee that must be paid is the higher of the two application fees.
