  "raw_text": "Related Pages\nAims and Scope of the Graduate Program\nThe Institute offers graduate programs in aerospace leading to the degrees of Master of Science in Aeronautics and Space Engineering, and Doctor of Philosophy in Aeronautics and Space Engineering. The programs are designed to provide intense education in the foundations of the aeronautical and space sciences, with emphasis on research and analytical, computational, and experimental methods. Entering graduate students should have a thorough background in undergraduate mathematics, physics, and engineering science.\nIn working toward a degree in aerospace, a student may pursue major study in one of the following areas: physics of fluids, physics of solids and mechanics of materials, structural mechanics, space technology, computational solid mechanics, computational and theoretical fluid dynamics, aeronautical engineering and propulsion, biomechanics of fluids and solids, technical fluid mechanics, control of aerospace systems and materials.\nWhile research and course work in the aerospace option at the Institute cover a very broad range of subjects, a choice of one of the above fields allows students to focus their activities while taking advantage of the flexibility offered by the breadth of interests of the Graduate aerospace Laboratories (GALCIT).\nIn consultation with their adviser, students will design a program of study in one of the above fields, consisting of the fundamental courses described in the regulations for the separate degrees listed below, and of electives selected from the list of aerospace-related courses. This will ensure that the graduating student will be well-qualified for a career in aerospace and related fields.\nExaminations, Committees, and Student Responsibilities\nTo help students achieve satisfactory progress in their academic pursuits, the aerospace faculty provides for the following committee and individual support.\nUpon beginning the first year of the aerospace program, each student is assigned a faculty (course) adviser whose research field matches the interests of the student as described in the student’s statement of purpose in their admissions application. The first-year adviser will guide the student in choosing a set of courses appropriate to the students’ interests while ensuring the first-year academic requirements (see below) are met.\nStudents wishing to pursue studies leading to the Ph.D. must select and be accepted by a research adviser by the end of the spring term of the first year of residence and are required to pass a qualifying examination in the first term of the second year. Having passed the qualifying examination, the student pursues research under the supervision of the research adviser until they are ready to enter candidacy for the Ph.D. At this point, a four-member Candidacy Examination Committee that includes the student’s research adviser is assembled and administers a Candidacy Examination to ensure the student has the appropriate knowledge and tools to successfully complete their chosen research activities. The Candidacy Committee is chaired by a faculty member other than the research adviser. The Candidacy Examination should be administered by the start of the second term of the third year of residence, but in any case, must be successfully completed by the end of that year in order to comply with Institute requirements.\nConferral of the Ph.D. degree is contingent on satisfactorily passing the thesis examination before a committee consisting of four examiners, which may, but does not need to, have the same membership as the Candidacy Committee. Students may find further information concerning special option requirements and the requisite option forms on the GALCIT website.\nAE Master’s Degrees\nMaster’s Degree in Aeronautics and Master’s Degree in Space Engineering\nThe master’s degree program in aeronautics or space engineering is a one-year program that provides advanced training in the areas of aeronautics or space engineering beyond that covered in a four-year undergraduate program. The program consists of a set of five core courses (see details below). There is no research requirement, nor is a thesis required to obtain the degree. The courses required for the master’s degree must be completed in one year.\nAdmission\nStudents whose highest qualification is a baccalaureate degree equivalent to that given by the Institute are eligible to seek admission to work toward the master’s degree. Students are asked to submit course transcripts and letters of recommendation as well as evidence of English language proficiency as detailed in the graduate application. Submission of GRE exam scores is optional for the 2025\nadmissions process in aerospace. It should be noted that the graduate program at GALCIT is primarily focused on Ph.D.-level research and so priority in admission is given to those who plan to ultimately perform Ph.D.-level research.\nCourse Requirements\nA program of study consists of courses totaling at least 135 units; of these, at least 81 units must be chosen from one of the following curricular tracks:\nAeronautics track\nTwo 27-unit course sequences chosen from:\nFluid mechanics (Ae/APh/CE/ME 101 abc)\nSolid/structural mechanics (Ae/AM/CE/ME 102abc)\nAutonomy and control (Ae103a in first term, Ae 103b in second term, and a third course selected from department list in coordination with first-year adviser), 27 units\nExperimental methods (Ae 104abc), 27 units.\nSpace Engineering track\nTwo 27-unit course sequences chosen from:\nFluid mechanics (Ae/APh/CE/ME 101 abc)\nSolid/structural mechanics (Ae/AM/CE/ME 102abc)\nAutonomy and control (Ae103a in first term, Ae 103b in second term, and a third course selected from department list in coordination with first-year adviser), 27 units\nSpace engineering (Ae 105abc), 27 units\nAerospace students in either the Aeronautics or Space Engineering track are required to enroll in a sequence of mathematics courses totaling 27 units appropriate to the student’s chosen track and selected in coordination with their first-year advisers. Examples of appropriate courses include ACM/IDS 104, ACM 100ab, ACM 101ab, etc.\nFinally, all first-year students are required to enroll in aerospace Engineering Seminar (3 units Ae 150abc).\nA grade of C or higher must be achieved in all the required classes unless they are only offered pass/fail, in which case a pass must be achieved in each class. For both the Aeronautics and Space Engineering master’s degrees, the remaining 27 units are elective and are to be chosen from courses at Caltech that support the broader goals of the respective programs, subject to the approval of the student’s adviser. Students must have a proposed program of courses approved by their adviser prior to registration for the first term of work toward the degree.\nAdmission to More Advanced Degrees\nStudents who successfully complete the requirements for the master’s degree and who wish to pursue the more advanced degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) must file a petition to continue work toward the desired degree. All students working for the Ph.D. degree are expected to register for and attend the advanced seminar (Ae 208 abc) for a period of at least two years.\nAE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\nAdmission\nStudents with a baccalaureate degree equivalent to that given by the Institute are eligible to seek admission to work toward the degree of doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in aeronautics or space engineering. Students are asked to submit course transcripts and letters of recommendation as well as evidence of English language proficiency as detailed in the graduate application. Submission of GRE exam scores is optional for the 2025 admissions process in aerospace.\nCourse Requirements\nThe course requirements for the first year of the Ph.D. degree are identical to those of the master’s degree. Students admitted to graduate study for the Ph.D. degree must complete in their first year a course of study that would qualify them for the master’s degree described above. The student may elect to receive the master’s degree at the end of their first year after completion of these courses.\nResearch Adviser\nStudents wishing to pursue studies leading to the Ph.D. must select and be accepted by a research adviser preferably by the end of their third quarter but no later than the end of their first year of study and prior to taking the qualifying examination described below.\nQualifying Examination\nAfter the first year of graduate study, the student must pass a qualifying examination. The objective of the qualifying examination is to determine if the student is properly prepared and qualified to pursue problems typical of Ph.D.-level research by demonstrating fundamental understanding of the first year courses in the topic area of the exam. The exam also evaluates effective oral communication of technical material as a skill that is required for professional development.\nThe exam will cover the following subjects:\nAeronautics track.\nTwo areas chosen from options a-c below:\nFluid mechanics\nSolid/structural mechanics\nAutonomy and control\nand a third exam in Mathematics\nSpace Engineering track.\nTwo areas chosen from options a-c below:\nFluid mechanics\nSolid/structural mechanics\nAutonomy and control\nand a third exam in Mathematics\nThe material covered in these examinations is at the same general level and breadth as covered in the corresponding first-year courses. The examinations are typically offered during one week in the first half of the fall term, in the second year of graduate residence at the Institute. A student is examined orally on all topics. In the event of an unsatisfactory performance, the examining faculty members may permit a repeat examination in the appropriate topics. The repeat examination must be scheduled prior to finals week of the winter term and must be completed before the end of the spring term of the same year.\nGraduate Teaching Assignment Duties\nGALCIT provides opportunities to students to improve their teaching and communication skills that are valuable in many contexts. Ph.D. students are required to perform a minimum of 18 term hours of Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) duties within the aerospace Department during their terms of residence. GTA duties will be assigned after the first year in residence and will be based on courses a student has completed.\nCandidacy\nTo be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. in aerospace, the applicant must\nhave satisfactorily completed at least 135 units of graduate work equivalent to the above Master of Science program;\npass, with a grade of C or better, 27 units of graduate-level mathematics courses beyond ACM 95/100, and ACM/IDS 104;\ncomplete (with a grade of C or better, or Pass if the course is only offered Pass/Fail) at least 45 units of aerospace courses numbered Ae 200 or higher, or Ae/ME 118, Ae/ME 120, EE/Ae 157, Ae 159, Ae/Ge/ME 160 and Ae/CE 165ab, excluding research and seminars;\nand\ncomplete three units of the advanced seminar Ae 208.\nA proposed program conforming to the above regulations must be approved by the student’s adviser and the option representative prior to add day of the first term of work toward the degree.\nIn addition to fulfilling these course requirements, the applicant must pass a candidacy examination in the third year of residence at the Institute. This exam should be administered by the start of the second quarter of the third year of residency. This examination aims at determining whether the student is successful in integrating formal course work into a mature understanding of fundamental engineering concepts, and at demonstrating their professional competence in applying these concepts to the problems being addressed in the course of their Ph.D. research.\nMinor\nNo minor is required for the Ph.D. degree. Students are, however, encouraged to take advanced courses appropriate to their particular interests or pursue a minor in consultation with their adviser.\nForeign Languages\nStudents are encouraged to discuss with their adviser the desirability of studying foreign languages, but there is no formal foreign language requirement for the Ph.D.\nThesis and Final Examination\nPrior to graduation, each candidate is required to give a seminar presenting the results of their thesis research. For final examination and thesis completion, see also the general degree requirements and the section on\nExaminations, Committees, and Student Responsibilities\nregarding aerospace. For a description of the Institute requirements for conferral of a Ph.D. see\nDegree of Doctor of Philosophy\n.\nSubject Minor\nA student majoring in a field other than aerospace may, with the approval of the option representative, elect aerospace as a subject minor. A minimum of 54 units in subjects acceptable to the aerospace faculty is required.\nProblem and Grievance Resolution within aerospace\nStudents may pursue several avenues for redress concerning personal and academic problems that may arise during their residency, as described earlier in the catalog. Should a student not wish to discuss the relevant issues with their adviser, the option representative and/or the director are always available to meet with the student.\nEducational Exchange Program with École Polytechnique\nAn educational exchange program is offered by the aerospace option with École Polytechnique (EP). In this exchange program, students selected for participation from Caltech will enroll for one year at EP. Correspondingly, students selected for the program from EP will enroll for one year at Caltech. To be eligible to participate, aerospace students must have completed one full year of study (for Caltech students this is equivalent to the requirements for the M.S. degree) and agree that they will spend one full year at EP. First year (G1) graduate students enrolled in Caltech’s doctoral aerospace program will be apprised of the opportunity to participate in an educational exchange program at the master’s level at EP. A maximum of two student(s) will be selected by the aerospace faculty from the pool of students who express interest in this program. Caltech students will follow their first (master’s) year at Caltech, and their second year in the second-year master’s (M2) program at EP. Caltech students must fulfill the requirements of their first-year program and receive their Caltech M.S. diploma prior to proceeding to EP.\nCaltech students must register at Caltech during the year spent at École Polytechnique and enroll in the special topics course Ae 240 – Educational exchange at École Polytechnique. This ensures that they maintain their standing as enrolled graduate students at Caltech. It is implied that classes taken at one institution cannot duplicate classes already taken at the other institution. The expectation is that Caltech students will return to Caltech after completing the EP program and continue with their doctoral studies at Caltech. Caltech students should be prepared to take the qualifying exams in the fall term when they return from EP. Caltech students participating in the Caltech/EP educational exchange program will be considered to be on detached duty from Caltech while at EP. A detached duty agreement will be executed for each student that spells out the terms and requirements for the detached duty.\nPublished Date:\n  \n  \n    Sept. 13, 2025",

For a description of the Institute requirements for conferral of a Ph.D. see Degree of Doctor of Philosophy . Subject Minor A student majoring in a field other than aerospace may, with the approval of the option representative, elect aerospace as a subject minor. A minimum of 54 units in subjects acceptable to the aerospace faculty is required. Problem and Grievance Resolution within aerospace Students may pursue several avenues for redress concerning personal and academic problems that may arise during their residency, as described earlier in the catalog. Should a student not wish to discuss the relevant issues with their adviser, the option representative and/or the director are always available to meet with the student. Educational Exchange Program with École Polytechnique An educational exchange program is offered by the aerospace option with École Polytechnique (EP). In this exchange program, students selected for participation from Caltech will enroll for one year at EP. Correspondingly, students selected for the program from EP will enroll for one year at Caltech. To be eligible to participate, aerospace students must have completed one full year of study (for Caltech students this is equivalent to the requirements for the M.S. degree) and agree that they will spend one full year at EP. First year (G1) graduate students enrolled in Caltech’s doctoral aerospace program will be apprised of the opportunity to participate in an educational exchange program at the master’s level at EP. A maximum of two student(s) will be selected by the aerospace faculty from the pool of students who express interest in this program. Caltech students will follow their first (master’s)",

Caltech students will follow their first (master’s) year at Caltech, and their second year in the second-year master’s (M2) program at EP. Caltech students must fulfill the requirements of their first-year program and receive their Caltech M.S. diploma prior to proceeding to EP. Caltech students must register at Caltech during the year spent at École Polytechnique and enroll in the special topics course Ae 240 – Educational exchange at École Polytechnique. This ensures that they maintain their standing as enrolled graduate students at Caltech. It is implied that classes taken at one institution cannot duplicate classes already taken at the other institution. The expectation is that Caltech students will return to Caltech after completing the EP program and continue with their doctoral studies at Caltech. Caltech students should be prepared to take the qualifying exams in the fall term when they return from EP. Caltech students participating in the Caltech/EP educational exchange program will be considered to be on detached duty from Caltech while at EP. A detached duty agreement will be executed for each student that spells out the terms and requirements for the detached duty.

Published Date: Sept. 8, 2025 Related Pages In addition to the required core classes described on the previous pages, first-year students are encouraged to participate in first-year seminar classes, frontier classes, research tutorials and other research opportunities. First Year Seminars are a series of seminars in which 10 to 15 first-year students and a faculty member explore in depth an exciting topic in the lab, around a table, or in the field. These courses cover a wide range of topics, including earthquakes, gravitational waves, and the science of music. Instructors may allow sophomores, juniors, or seniors to enroll in these seminars after the conclusion of the pre-registration period for the upcoming term. See section on First-Year Seminars for more information. Caltech also offers a series of “frontier courses” that involve a weekly presentation by a faculty member on a topic of current research.

See section on First-Year Seminars for more information. Caltech also offers a series of “frontier courses” that involve a weekly presentation by a faculty member on a topic of current research. These courses often meet at lunch time and serve pizza; hence, students refer to the courses as “pizza courses.” The frontier courses are an opportunity for students to meet the Caltech faculty and to hear about state-of-the-art research projects for the summer or academic year. There are a total of 10 frontier courses offered for first-year students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, geology and planetary sciences, engineering, computer science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, and electrical engineering. Currently there are three “research tutorials” for first-year students: one in physics, one in biology, and one in chemistry. These tutorials have many of the same features as the first-year seminars. In physics, the research tutorial includes approximately seven first-year students and extends over three academic terms plus the summer. The purpose is to demonstrate how research opportunities arise, are evaluated, and are tested, and how the ideas that survive develop in larger projects. In biology and chemistry, the tutorials are offered in the winter and spring quarters and involve small group discussions on special areas or problems in biology, biotechnology, and chemistry. More than 80 percent of Caltech students participate in research at some point in their academic career. Students may embark on research activities by registering for research credits with a faculty member, by working in a laboratory for pay during the summer or academic year, by completing a senior thesis, or by participating in Caltech’s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program. The SURF program is described Undergraduate Programs and Research . Published Date: Sept. 13, 2025",
