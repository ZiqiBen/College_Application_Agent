  "raw_text": "Related Pages\nAims and Scope of the Graduate Program\nGraduate study in computer science within the Computing & Mathematical Sciences department is oriented principally toward Ph.D. research. The Ph.D. program requires a minimum of three academic years of residence; required coursework is generally completed within the first two years. Students must maintain high academic standards during their graduate residence. A student’s Ph.D. research must exhibit originality in the formulation, analysis, and solution of a problem that is significant to the field of study. The option representative and executive officers are available to discuss concerns regarding academic progress.\nCS Master’s Degree\nThe CS Option only admits students who plan to pursue the Ph.D. degree. The M.S. degree may be awarded in exceptional cases at the discretion of the CS Option Representative. To be eligible, students must complete the following requirements:\nAll Institute M.S. requirements;\nThe classwork requirements for the CS Ph.D. program;\nRecommendation to award the M.S. from the CS preliminary examination committee.\nCS Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\nCourse requirements\nStudents must complete a minimum of 135 units of courses numbered 100 or greater, including research units (CS 280). Students should consult with their adviser to ensure balance in the selected courses.\nThe coursework must include:\nCMS 290 is required for all first year CS graduate students during each term (fall/winter/spring).\nAdvanced courses in computer science. Completion of a minimum of 54 units of CS courses numbered 100 or greater in addition to units earned for reading, research, and independent projects. Up to 24 of the 54 units may be taken from non-CS courses from CMS or ACM, including CMS/ACM/IDS 107, CMS/ACM/EE 122 and CMS 117, or other courses with approval from the option representative.\nCompletion of a minimum of 27 additional units of coursework (not including research units) labeled 100 and above, in any academic discipline.\nPreliminary examination\nToward the end of the first year, all incoming students must take a preliminary examination administered by the faculty. Its purpose is to ensure a solid and broad knowledge in computer science, and in the event of a deficiency, to direct the students to necessary courses and reading.\nCandidacy\nTo be recommended for candidacy, a student must have completed the required coursework, have passed the preliminary examination, have entered upon a course of research approved by their thesis adviser, and have passed a candidacy oral examination. The candidacy oral examination is administered by a committee that consists of four faculty that is approved by the option representative. The chair of the committee must be a Caltech professorial faculty member distinct from the adviser. The examination ascertains the student’s breadth and depth of preparation for research in the chosen area. The candidacy examination should be taken within the first three years of graduate study.\nAdvising and Thesis Supervision\nIn order to facilitate close supervision and a highly research-oriented environment, each student is admitted directly to an adviser and research group. A course of study is determined in consultation with the adviser. Occasionally students will be admitted into more than one group. Changes in affiliation may occur with the common consent of the student, the new adviser, and the option representative.\nStudents meet regularly with their adviser throughout their time at Caltech, and are encouraged to do the same with other members of the faculty.\nAcademic progress will be reviewed regularly, including at least once annually by the option representative.\nAn ability to explain concepts and to verbally present one’s work is vital to a successful career in research and/or teaching. To this end, students may be required by their advisor and the option representative to occasionally serve as a teaching assistant.\nThesis and Final Examination\nA final oral examination will be scheduled and given after the Ph.D. thesis has been submitted for review to the student’s adviser and thesis committee; the latter consists of at least four faculty approved by the option representative. The chair of the committee must be a Caltech professorial faculty member distinct from the adviser. The thesis examination is a defense of the thesis research and a test of the candidate’s knowledge in their specialized fields.\nSubject Minor in Computer Science\nA subject minor is not required for the Ph.D. degree in computer science. PhD students majoring in other fields may take a subject minor in computer science consisting of 45 CS units numbered 100 or greater. The minor must be supervised by a computer science faculty adviser and approved by the computer science option representative, a year in advance of graduation. The courses must be sufficiently removed from the student’s major program of study and must include CS 138 (CS 139 may be substituted) unless the student has previously taken an equivalent course. The courses in the plan must be taken for grades and the student is required to achieve an A- average in them.\nPublished Date:\n  \n  \n    Aug. 27, 2025",

Published Date: Sept. 8, 2025 Related Pages In addition to the required core classes described on the previous pages, first-year students are encouraged to participate in first-year seminar classes, frontier classes, research tutorials and other research opportunities. First Year Seminars are a series of seminars in which 10 to 15 first-year students and a faculty member explore in depth an exciting topic in the lab, around a table, or in the field. These courses cover a wide range of topics, including earthquakes, gravitational waves, and the science of music. Instructors may allow sophomores, juniors, or seniors to enroll in these seminars after the conclusion of the pre-registration period for the upcoming term. See section on First-Year Seminars for more information. Caltech also offers a series of “frontier courses” that involve a weekly presentation by a faculty member on a topic of current research. These courses often meet at lunch time and serve pizza; hence, students refer to the courses as “pizza courses.” The frontier courses are an opportunity for students to meet the Caltech faculty and to hear about state-of-the-art research projects for the summer or academic year. There are a total of 10 frontier courses offered for first-year students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, geology and planetary sciences, engineering, computer science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, and electrical engineering.

There are a total of 10 frontier courses offered for first-year students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, geology and planetary sciences, engineering, computer science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, and electrical engineering. Currently there are three “research tutorials” for first-year students: one in physics, one in biology, and one in chemistry. These tutorials have many of the same features as the first-year seminars. In physics, the research tutorial includes approximately seven first-year students and extends over three academic terms plus the summer. The purpose is to demonstrate how research opportunities arise, are evaluated, and are tested, and how the ideas that survive develop in larger projects. In biology and chemistry, the tutorials are offered in the winter and spring quarters and involve small group discussions on special areas or problems in biology, biotechnology, and chemistry. More than 80 percent of Caltech students participate in research at some point in their academic career. Students may embark on research activities by registering for research credits with a faculty member, by working in a laboratory for pay during the summer or academic year, by completing a senior thesis, or by participating in Caltech’s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program.
