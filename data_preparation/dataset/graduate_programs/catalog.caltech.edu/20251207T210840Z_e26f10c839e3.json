  "raw_text": "Related Pages\nAims and Scope of the Graduate Program\nMechanical engineering (ME) research and study are offered through the Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering (MCE). The degrees of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and Master of Science (M.S.) are offered. In general, students who intend to work full-time toward the Ph.D. degree as a final degree objective are admitted to the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Program. The M.S. degree is typically only awarded to students who pursue the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering at Caltech and who do not already have an M.S. degree in mechanical engineering.\nThe aim of the graduate program in mechanical engineering at Caltech is to prepare students for research and professional practice in an era of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technology. The program combines individual depth of experience and competence in a particular chosen major specialty, with a strong background in the basic and engineering sciences. It strives to develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the capacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth.\nME Preparation for the Graduate Program\nEntering graduate students are expected to have a thorough background in undergraduate mathematics, physics, and engineering. While a strong undergraduate program in mechanical engineering should provide a suitable preparation, students who have not specialized in mechanical engineering as undergraduates may also be admitted for graduate study. For example, an outstanding four-year undergraduate program in mathematics and sciences may provide a suitable background as well. The qualifications of each applicant will be considered individually, and after being enrolled, the student will arrange their program in consultation with a member of the faculty.\nME Master’s Degree\nThe degree of Master of Science in mechanical engineering is only awarded to students who do not already have an M.S. degree in mechanical engineering. The degree will be awarded upon request by students who have fulfilled the requirements. Only in exceptional cases is there admission to the M.S. program as the final degree objective.\nA minimum of 138 units of courses numbered 100 or above, which meet the required master’s program listed below, must be passed with a grade of at least C for completion of the master’s degree in mechanical engineering. All units must be taken for grades, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis. The M.S. degree in mechanical engineering is typically completed within the first two years of residency at Caltech.\nEach student’s program must be approved by the adviser and option representative in mechanical and civil engineering before registering for the course.\nRequired Master’s Program\nGraduate mechanical engineering core (54 units). These units should provide a solid base for the student’s engineering interest. The courses should be selected from the Core ME subjects listed under the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Description and Requirements section.\nMathematics, engineering, and research electives (54 units). Courses may be taken in Ae, AM, ACM, ME, MedE, MS, EE, ESE, APh, CDS, CS, ChE, and CNS, except seminar courses. Students are encouraged to take research units, ME 300, up to a maximum of 27.\nFree electives (27 units). Any course with a number of 100 or greater may be selected, except that research units and seminar courses can not be included.\nGraduate Engineering Seminar, AM/CE/ME 150 abc (3 units).\nME Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\nThe Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering is focused on research. Study and research programs for the Ph.D. degree are individually planned to fit the interests and background of the student. A comprehensive research project resulting in an original contribution to the field documented by a dissertation is required. A minimum of three academic years in residence as a graduate student are required by the Institute, and two or more additional years are usually needed for the preparation of the thesis.\nAdvising and Thesis Supervision\nAn interim adviser is appointed for each student upon admission to a graduate degree in mechanical engineering. The interim adviser will serve as the primary mentor until the student finds a research adviser. It is the responsibility of the student to find an academic and research adviser within three terms of graduate residence at Caltech. In consultation with the adviser, the student must form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee within four terms of graduate residence at Caltech. This committee shall consist of at least three members of the Caltech professorial faculty, with at least two members from the faculty in mechanical and civil engineering. The committee shall meet as requested by the student. Further, the committee shall meet annually to review progress and to approve the registration of the student beyond the fifth year of graduate residence at Caltech.\nThe adviser and the Thesis Advisory Committee provide the majority of mentoring to the student. In addition, the option representative and other members of the faculty are always available to provide advice and mentoring on any aspect of research, progress toward the Ph.D., future careers, and other aspects of life in graduate school and as a professional scientist.\nAdmission to Candidacy\nTo be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering, the student must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements, do the following:\nObtain the agreement of a professorial faculty member to serve as the students academic and research adviser before the end of the third term of graduate residence at Caltech. In consultation with the adviser, the student must form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee before the end of the fourth term. This committee shall consist of at least three members of the Caltech professorial faculty, with at least two members from the faculty in mechanical and civil engineering.\nPass both subject and research components of the oral candidacy examination before the end of the eighth term of graduate academic residence at Caltech. If the student has chosen a subject minor, an examination on the subject of that program may be included at the request of the discipline offering the subject minor.\nComplete a minimum of 195 units of courses numbered 101 or above, that fulfill the required Ph.D. program listed below. All units must be taken for grades and passed with a grade of at least a C, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis. The coursework towards the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering is typically completed within the first three years of residency at Caltech.\nThe faculty will evaluate the student’s research progress, class performance, adviser’s input, and oral candidacy exam results to determine whether a student will be admitted to or be able to maintain candidacy for the Ph.D. degree.\nRequired Ph.D. Program\nME Core Subjects\n(54 units): Coursework in core mechanical engineering subjects selected from the courses below.
