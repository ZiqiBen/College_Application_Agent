Qualifying exam : Students are required to complete a research-based written report and oral qualifying exam before the end of their second year. Both the written report and oral presentation will focus on novel research completed by the student, advised by a faculty member as part of the ASTR 298 (Directed Studies) course requirement. For more details, see Qualification Exam . Candidacy exam : Qualified students are required to submit a written thesis proposal and conduct an oral presentation with their Dissertation Committee before the end of their third year. Students whose proposal is approved will be designated Ph.D. Candidates. For more GEPA details, see Advance to Candidancy . Dissertation and defense : Ph.D. degree recipients must complete a written dissertation and oral presentation, to be approved by the candidate's Dissertation Committee. The normative time for completion of the dissertation is by the end of the fifth year, with a formal limit of the end of the seventh year . For more GEPA details, see Dissertation Submission .
