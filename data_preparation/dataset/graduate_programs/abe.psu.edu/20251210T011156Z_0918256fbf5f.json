The BioRenewable Systems (BRS) degree is offered as a resident instruction, research-based M.S. and Ph.D. programs. The degree requires a thesis at the master’s level and a dissertation at the doctoral level. The BRS graduate program encompasses renewable biologically-based materials, products, and processes and fully integrates scientific research with the principles of systems technology, business, management, marketing, leadership development, and entrepreneurship. Toward that end, the academic requirements for BRS are closely related to the disciplinary focus of agricultural and biological sciences, technological innovation and application, and business, management, and leadership within the continually evolving biobased sectors. This multidisciplinary aspect makes BRS unique from other fields of science and management. To promote and fulfill this uniqueness, the continuation of courses in science, business, management, and technology at the graduate level is encouraged and expected. Excellent facilities, including equipment and instrumentation, are available for research in the designated areas. Collaborative arrangements allow access to a large variety of other resources: Materials Research Institute; Penn State Institutes of the Energy and Environment; Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences; Housing Research Center; USDA Pasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Lab; a mushroom research and demonstration facility; and a 1,500-acre agricultural research center for cooperative work with agronomic and horticultural production systems as well as animal production systems.

Completion of a relevant undergraduate Bachelor degree program is required for admission to the M.S. degree program; relevant programs span a diverse set of academic disciplines, including but not limited to: Agricultural Sciences, Biology, Chemistry, Business, Engineering, and Environmental Sciences. Students with junior-senior GPA of at least 3.00 (4.00 base) will be competitive in the admission process. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) The program requirement for acceptance to graduate study toward a Ph.D. degree in BRS is typically an M.S. degree with research thesis in BRS or related discipline such as: Agricultural Sciences, Biology, Chemistry, Business, Engineering, and Environmental Sciences, or with a B.S. degree in Agricultural Systems Management (ASM) or BRS or equivalent. Outstanding students interested in direct admission from a B.S., B.A., or M.B.A. program to the Ph.D. Program should contact the Graduate Program Coordinator for further clarification and details. Direct admission will be based on critical evaluation of the student’s: potential to conduct publishable research, academic record, an additional language (other than the student’s mother tongue), performance on standardized tests, statement of purpose, and reference letters. Students who apply directly to the Ph.D. program with a B.S. degree and are deemed by the admissions committee not to meet the standards for admission to the Ph.D. program may be considered either for admission into the M.S. program or for admission to the Ph.D. program on a provisional basis .

When do I register for the next semester? Registration is done by levels and Graduate Students are among the first group. Approximately the 4th week of the semester ( see calendar table) . It is important to do this according to the timetable or within a few weeks of the timetable. This is the first step in the automated system indicating that you are continuing student. Registering early or on time will ensure your estimated tuition bill will be emailed to you. How do I complete registration? File the estimated tuition bill via LionPATH before the start of the semester. You will receive an email letting you know that your bill is ready for payment. New students may need to check with Stef Hugill if their bill is not available at the start of the semester. There can be a delay if the paperwork for your graduate assistantship appointment has not been processed. Regardless of funding, i.e. Graduate Assistantship, Fellowship, or self-funded the tuition bill must be filed to complete registration. If the bill is not filed before the start of classes your account will be frozen and among other things you will not be able to adjust your course schedule. Detailed information can be found on the University Registrar's website . What does it mean to be continuously registered? Register as a full time student every semester (excluding summer) For M. S. students, full time is 9 credits For Ph.D. students before completion of the Comprehensive Exam, full time is 9 credits. For Ph.D. students after completion of the Comprehensive Exam, registering for ABE 601 is considered full time. Why do I have to complete Semi Annual Progress Reports?
