It employs more than 400 undergraduates each semester, and every one of these students is given the chance to impact their course in meaningful ways and work closely with the professor, other UTAs, and other students. Students often find being a Brown CS UTA to be a formative part of their Brown experience and build long-lasting friendships through the program. UTAs and non-UTAs alike can use this page to better understand the program and all of the amazing opportunities that lie in store for a would-be UTA! The UTA program is coordinated by the MTAs . The current MTAs are Ilan Brauns, Skylar Walters, Matthias Yee, Duru Huseyni, and Ilija Ivanov. Want to learn more?
