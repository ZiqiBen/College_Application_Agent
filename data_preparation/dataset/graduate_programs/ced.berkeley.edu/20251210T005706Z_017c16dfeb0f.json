Graduates emerge uniquely prepared to tackle the challenges facing contemporary cities, with plenty of hands-on experience to complement classroom instruction. Both the full-time program and part-time program share the same curriculum. Finance + Affordable Housing Concentrations In the Abbey MRED+D program, you have the option to pursue a concentration in finance or affordable housing , available to both full-time and part-time students. To earn a concentration, students must complete pre-approved electives — finance concentration electives are offered through the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business, while affordable housing electives are offered through the Department of City & Regional Planning. Ben Metcalf , managing director of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation and research professor of City & Regional Planning, serves as the affordable housing concentration advisor.

HOW TO APPLY DEGREE TRACKS DEPARTMENT NEWS FOLLOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM Berkeley’s Master of Architecture is centered around the design studio and enriched by courses in building science and technology, sustainability and history, theory, and society. As an MArch student, you’ll work closely with your classmates and professors in our light-filled open-plan studio to develop and represent your design ideas. You’re encouraged to identify your own creative and research passions, with the support of your instructors and peers. Design is the core of the curriculum, and students enroll in an architectural design studio each semester. Working collaboratively with your cohort in design studios, you’ll learn how to create architecture that serves both communities and the environment over the long term. We offer two tracks leading to the MArch degree, a two-year track and a three-year track, depending on your previous educational experience and the recommendation of the admissions committee. The MArch program is for those seeking their first accredited professional degree in Architecture. If you hold a five-year professional bachelor of architecture degree from a NAAB-accredited school or a comparable five-year degree from a foreign university or technical institute, you may be eligible to apply for our one-year post-professional Master of Advanced Architectural Design (MAAD) . Berkeley’s MArch is a full-time residential degree program accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) and designated as a STEM degree by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The Department of Architecture offers you a rich intellectual community rooted in the dynamic contexts of UC Berkeley, the Bay Area, and California. As a graduate student at the nation’s top public research university, you’ll be part of a diverse community of changemakers known worldwide for innovation and academic excellence. Our passion for critical inquiry, debate, and creative experimentation is informed by a deep commitment to social equity and climate solutions. The Bay Area led the movement to reshape architecture through a humanistic lens and today it’s home to some of the profession’s most innovative designers. California, the birthplace of the environmental movement and social justice advocacy, is at leading edge of making our cities more just and climate resilient. The state’s diverse population, 40 million strong, and its rich and varied conditions make it the ideal laboratory for our discipline. About the College of Environmental Design The Department of Architecture, established at UC Berkeley in 1903, was one of the founding departments in the College of Environmental Design. When the college was created in 1959, it was the first in the nation to unite the disciplines of architecture, planning, and landscape architecture, leading the way toward an integrated approach to analyzing, understanding, and designing our built environment. The college emphasizes environmental design as a profoundly ethical practice , inseparable from social, political, economic, and cultural contexts and co-produced through dynamic engagements with diverse communities. Principles of Community The College of Environmental Design is committed to building an inclusive environment for our faculty, students and staff that respects and reflects the diverse communities in which we live and work. We use design, research and teaching as drivers of change toward equitable futures. Commitment to diversity Spacing: medium OUR FACULTY Our multidisciplinary faculty have expertise in design, building science and technology, and history and theory of architecture.

Perched atop Wurster Hall, Room 1000 is also a small, unemphasized room with expansive views of Berkeley, the San Francisco Bay, and the ocean beyond. Like its namesake, the journal serves as a vantage point from which one might observe contemporary architecture as it operates in relation to the city, the landscape, and the many forces, institutions, and people that help shape them. The journal is thought of as a medium: as both a platform for conversation and a vehicle for generation. Degree Tracks Both the two-year and three-year MArch degree tracks lead to a NAAB-accredited MArch degree that prepares you for the practice of architecture and meets the education requirement for pursuing your architecture license . The curriculum of both tracks is organized around the core design studio, which is the setting for the synthesis and integration of technical, environmental, historical, and theoretical course offerings. Students in the three-year track will take 6 studios, and students in the two-year track will take 4 studios. In your first year of the three-year track is focused on the development of architectural design and representational skills. The second year of the three-year track and the first year of the two-year track focus on architecture + urbanism in the fall semester. The option studio in the spring semester of this year is taught by visiting professors from around the world, and has a studio travel component. In your final year , you will get to apply your knowledge in an integrated studio in the fall and create your own thesis project in the spring.
