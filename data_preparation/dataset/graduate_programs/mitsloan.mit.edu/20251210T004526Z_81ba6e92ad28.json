The course provides a very practical approach to applying modern machine-learning methods to problems in the financial domain.\nCollapse\nAI and Money\n'AI & Money' examines the evolving impact of artificial intelligence on finance, money, and risk. The goal is to help students gain critical reasoning skills on how to seize commercial opportunities - and maintain relevance - at the intersection of these two dynamically changing fields. One - AI - a set of rapidly changing tools. The other - finance - is a dynamic network for the pricing and allocation of money and risk.\nStudents will explore how machine learning, generative AI, and advanced analytics are redefining asset management, trading, underwriting, finance functions, customer interactions, and compliance.

This is also one of the areas of management most thoroughly documented in the financial press and the academic literature. The subject explores three aspects of the merger and acquisition process: the strategic decision to acquire, the valuation decision of how much to pay, and the financing decision on how to fund the acquisition. Class sessions alternate between discussions of academic readings and applied cases.\nCollapse\nPublic versus Private Capital Markets\nReviews the merits and trade-offs of public versus private capital markets, which have witnessed tremendous growth over the last decade, from a corporate governance standpoint.
