All applications are evaluated holistically to assess an applicant’s preparation and potential for graduate coursework and independent research.\nCOVID-19 Personal Statement Prompt Update\nGraduate Division has created a new section to the application this year that gives applicants an opportunity to describe how COVID-19 has impacted their educational experience in relation to their academic performance, grading scale, or research experience. For example: \"For the spring semester, my university let us take two classes P/NP and I chose this because...\" or \"For the spring quarter, my college graded all classes as P/NP and we didn't have an option for a letter grade\" or \"For spring term, my lab was unavailable due to campus closure so I was unable to do experiments. Instead, I worked remotely on modelling related to my research project.\"\nThis section is optional, but applicants should complete this section so we can better understand their experiences.\nSome topics to consider:\nHow did you pursue your goals for research and advanced study in Physics during the COVID-19 pandemic?\nWhat grading system did your university adopt during the pandemic, and how did this affect you?\nWere there any classes you planned to take, or research activities you planned to pursue, but were unable to due to campus restrictions? What did you do in lieu of these?\nDiagnostic Exam (if accepted into the PhD program)\nEntering students must take an entrance diagnostic exam on Undergraduate Physics the summer before they start in the program. The exam will cover mechanics, electricity & magnetism, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, & math methods. Students who are found to have serious weaknesses in preparation will be directed to enroll in appropriate undergraduate upper division courses.\nFee Waiver Program\nThere are a couple of fee waiver programs offered by the Division of Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs (GEPA) and the Department of Physics.\nPlease visit the GEPA website (\nhttps://grad.ucsd.edu/admissions/requirements/application-fee-and-fee-waiver/index.html\n) to see if you are eligible for a fee waiver with them. Follow their steps to request for one of their fee waivers.\nIf you are not eligible for an application fee waiver through GEPA, then please follow the steps below to be considered for one of our limited number of fee waivers by our department.\nPlease fill out the application as much as you can\n(\nhttps://connect.grad.ucsd.edu/apply/\n)\nDo not submit the application nor enter any payment information\nTake note of your application's reference number (you'll need that for the next step)\nFill out our\nFee Waiver Request Form\nThe deadline to be considered for one of the department's application fee waivers is December 1, 2025.\nIf selected for an application fee waiver, we will contact you with further instructions by December 5, 2025.\nRevised for 2026-2027 admissions",

Students are required to complete the following requirements: complete the departmental diagnostic exam prior to the start of classes, satisfactorily pass the departmental core courses and electives for qualification, complete five advanced graduate courses, a PhD candidacy examination, teaching requirement, and a final defense of the thesis as described below. Diagnostic Exam Entering students must take an entrance diagnostic exam on Undergraduate Physics. The exam will cover mechanics, electricity & magnetism, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics & math methods. Students who are found to have serious weaknesses in preparation will be directed to enroll in appropriate undergraduate upper division courses. Core Courses and Electives for Qualification Physics students are required to take 7 core courses (PHYS 200A Theoretical Mechanics I, PHYS 201 Mathematical Methods in Physics, PHYS 203A&B Advanced Classical Electrodynamics I & II, PHYS 210A Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics, PHYS 212A&B Quantum Mechanics I & II) with a grade of B or better and two elective courses with a grade of B+ or better. Elective courses may also count toward the department’s Advanced Graduate Course requirement. Students are expected to complete these courses by the end of their 1st year with the requisite grades but will be given up to two years to complete. A department Qualification Committee will review all students and recommend corrective measures for students who do not meet the course grade standards. Students who do not qualify after two years may be asked to",

Students who do not qualify after two years may be asked to leave the program. Biophysics PhD students will be expected to complete these courses by the end of their 2nd year with the requisite grades but will be given an additional year if necessary. Advanced Graduate Courses Physics Ph.D. students are required to take five advanced graduate courses (with a grade of C or better) from at least three of the groups listed below no later than the end of the third year in the program. A 3.0 in four of the five courses is required. (In lieu of the course requirement, students may petition to take an oral examination covering three areas of physics.) Note: Biophysics students select five courses from Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, or Physics in consultation with their adviser. At least three of these courses must be graduate courses. Physics courses are to be selected from Groups 1-8 listed below. Group 1 (Plasma) Phys 218A-B-C (Plasma) Phys 235 (Nonlinear Plasma Th) Group 2 (Cond.

For more information, see Teaching Requirement . Qualifying Examination and Advancement to Candidacy In order to be advanced to candidacy, students must have met the departmental requirements and obtained a faculty research supervisor. At the time of application for advancement to candidacy, a doctoral committee responsible for the remainder of the student's graduate program is appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies & Research. The committee conducts the Ph.D. qualifying examination during which students must demonstrate the ability to engage in thesis research. Usually this involves the presentation of a plan for the thesis research project. The committee may ask questions directly or indirectly related to the project and questions on general physics which it determines to be relevant. Upon successful completion of this examination, students are advanced to candidacy and are awarded the C.Phil. Degree. For more information, see Advancement to Candidacy . Thesis Defense When students have completed their theses, they are asked to present and defend them before their doctoral committees. For more information, see Final Dissertation Defense .
