MBA Curriculum Year 1: Core Year 1: Core Look at issues from all sides to see the big picture The series of first-year core courses is carefully planned to build your understanding of the whole organization, eventually building to big questions of business’s impact on society. Orientation to Management gives you the tools and the frameworks that you’ll need for the remainder of your MBA career. In the Organizational Perspectives courses, you’ll learn to rigorously apply those tools and draw on a variety of disciplines to illuminate the perspectives of various stakeholders. All of those perspectives come together in The Executive, which teaches you to take a CEO’s view of the entire organization and tackle major challenges. We believe you make better decisions when you take into account the many stakeholders affected by your actions, rather than looking at things through a single disciplinary lens. Our curriculum is built around engaging with real problems and accounting for the extended effects of leadership decisions on organizations, communities, and individuals. Orientation to Management Courses Orientation to Management is a series of foundational courses. This series of courses teaches you the skills and language you will need in any career in business and management.

This course emphasizes anticipating the actions of the marketplace participants, including governments, nonprofit organizations, and corporations, that function as competitors and cooperators. Customer Learn to develop a deep understanding of customer behavior, integrate that understanding across an organization, and align the organizational structure to satisfy current customer needs and adapt to changes in customer needs, using tools from economics, psychology, and sociology. Investor This course is about investors: what they do, how they think, and what they care about.

Topics include measuring corporate value creation, company valuation, capital structure decisions, and capital budgeting.

Operations Engine The course broadens the traditional operations management course by including and emphasizing linkages to organizational behavior and workforce management, strategy, accounting, finance, and marketing. At its heart, this course is about using quantitative models to provide managerial insights into the improvement of work processes, the design and improvement of the supply chain, and the competitive strategy. The Global Macroeconomy This course develops a framework for understanding the causes and consequences of macroeconomic events in real time, a useful input to the management of any enterprise, local or global, profit or nonprofit. We compare countries’ economic structure and performance over time and consider models in which the choices of private and public agents interact to produce aggregate outcomes in response to policy or economic shocks. The Executive This course consists of series of interdisciplinary cases structured to describe challenges faced by leaders of organizations of differing size, scope, and sector, asking students to bring together skills learned throughout the core curriculum. All of the cases involve current situations, and much of the class material is “raw,” consisting of financial filings, data sets, news reports, company material, and other primary source data.
