To achieve this, we will apply the methodology of neoclassical economic analysis to understand the role and function of government and governmental decision-making; explore the intersection between economics and the law; and learn to spot legal issues before they become grounds for termination, lawsuits or criminal indictments. Emphasis is placed on high-impact regulatory programs, such as antitrust, security regulation, civil rights and environmental laws.

Ben Soeter Master of Accounting Program Structure The Rice MAcc is a 10-month, 33-credit hour program. The curriculum is lockstep and cohort-based, meaning you will take the same courses at the same time as your fellow MAcc students. Classes meet during the daytime in McNair Hall, Rice’s business school building. Courses You will take courses in financial accounting, tax accounting, managerial accounting, and auditing. But you will also take courses in data analytics, finance, business law, and ethics. As the schematic above shows, we have designed a unique course schedule to optimize your learning in an accelerated program. The Rice MAcc has three types of courses: semester long courses, half semester-long courses, and “Intensive Learning Unit” (ILU) courses. The two ILU courses last just one week but meet four hours a day, Monday through Friday, so that you can fully focus on one topic. CPA Exam Eligibility Together with an undergraduate degree and prerequisite accounting and general business courses, the Rice University Master of Accounting (MAcc) program is intended to meet the educational requirements for CPA licensure in Texas. Since the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy has sole authority in determining whether credits earned are acceptable for examination and licensure, prospective students should work with an advisor to ensure they are completing appropriate coursework. Additional non-educational requirements, such as work experience and an ethics exam, also are required for CPA licensure. Whether the Rice MAcc program meets the education requirements for jurisdictions outside of Texas depends on the student’s undergraduate coursework and degree. Prospective students should therefore work with an advisor to evaluate CPA eligibility education requirements for the jurisdiction in which they wish to sit for the exam.
