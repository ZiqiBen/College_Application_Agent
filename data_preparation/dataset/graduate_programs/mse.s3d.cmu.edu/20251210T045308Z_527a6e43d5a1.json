Or, maybe you have reached a plateau in your career, and you are eager to reach the next level? The Master of Software Engineering (MSE) program for professionals builds on a foundation of skills and industry experience, and teaches you state-of-the-art practices used by top software engineering companies.\nThe MSE program is designed for experienced software developers with at least two years of full-time professional experience. The program includes coursework on requirements, architecture, analysis and project management, while providing students with greater flexibility in directing their education. The program is an on-campus, 16-month long program when pursued full-time. Part-time options are available for U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents of the United States.\nWhat are the prerequisites for admissions?\nWhat classes will I take?\nWhat is a \"Studio Project\" and why is it important?\nBecome the Best of the Best\n\"The MSE taught me a lot about perseverance and work ethics, my own limits in terms of what I could do and what I might accomplish.

The program typically begins in the Fall semester, and consists of synchronous meetings with program faculty, and asynchronous lectures and assignments. Courses are typically divided into 7-week long \"mini\" courses that allow students to concurrently learn a wider range of topics, while scaffolding learning to more advanced topics later in the program. For example, the fall semester is broken into two mini semesters, mini-1 and mini-2. A dedicated student can anticipate completing the program in 6 semesters (2 years). The maximum amount of time allowed to complete the program is 7 years. Sample 2-year courses of study are below.

Syllabus [PDF] 17-660 Designing and Managing Software Systems Platforms (E) Platform economy has taken over many industries. It essentially has a network effect on the way services between industries are consumed. Instead of competing, businesses often leverage each others strengths to enhance their business. They engage each other in coopetition rather than competition. This course starts with discussing an overview of platform economy and its benefits. Creating software system platforms requires a different way of approaching the software development. It requires software engineers to focus on the domain and design reusable entities and services that support variety and evolvability. Domain driven design (DDD) is one of the proven approaches for identifying reusable assets. A systematic approach to designing systems using DDD techniques is dealt with in this course. To ensure robustness of the platform, it must be deployed and managed on reliable infrastructures. Incidents and outages must be dealt with efficiently. In this course the students will learn disaster recovery management. Topics such as incident investigation, RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) planning with respect to business goals, among others, will be discussed. Most software systems platforms today are deployed in the Cloud environment that poses additional issues. Cloud deployment and monitoring will be discussed in this course. As the software system platform goes into production, we need to have confidence in the operation of the platform. Chaos engineering addresses many of these issues by creating hypotheses on past outages and developing experiments for the possible incidents.

Syllabus [PDF] 17-691 Machine Learning in Practice (E) As Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods have become common place in both academic and industry environments many resources have focused on methods and techniques for applications. However, there are other considerations that must be addressed when deploying such techniques into practice (or production). The purpose of this course is to cover topics relevant to building a machine learning system deployed into operations. Such systems have technical requirements including data management, model development, and deployment. However, business/organizational impacts must also be considered. Machine learning systems can be expensive to produce and operate. Students will learn about trade-offs in design, implementation, and expected value . Syllabus [PDF] 17-693 Negotiations for Software Leaders (E) Negotiation skills are fundamental to professionals in all fields. Indeed, a strong argument can be made that almost every interaction that humans engage in is a negotiation in one form or another. This can be particularly important in technology-related industries and positions, where individuals may find themselves negotiating a job offer, attempting to convince upper management to back a new product or project, or trying to agree on deal terms for a corporate merger or a venture capital investment. The ability to identify your goals and alternatives, to effectively engage with a negotiating partner, and to define and achieve a positive outcome is critical to success in these and numerous other endeavors — and those who excel at handling these kinds of complex and often nuanced interactions will achieve greater success for themselves and their organizations.

Syllabus [PDF] 17-695 Design Patterns (C MSE-SS) (E MSE, MSE-ES, MSE Online) Attributes of a good quality software, among others are ease of maintenance, modifiability, extensibility, and reusability. Design Patterns, that are mined from existing well-designed software, improve quality through documented and proven solutions to common problems. Reusing good designs appropriately not only improves the quality, but also reduces the development cost. Many existing code without much documentation also can benefit by refactoring to patterns. In this course students will learn techniques to identify design problems and apply design patterns effectively to improve the quality of software. Learning will be facilitated via lectures, flip-classrooms, and a group project. Learning will also be reinforced with many in-class and homework exercises. Syllabus [PDF] Software and Societal Systems Department › Master of Software Engineering Programs › For Applicants › Course Spotlight MSE Course Spotlight 17-695 Design Patterns , taught by Associate Teaching Professor Swarnalatha Ashok, focuses on the techniques necessary to identify design problems, mine design patterns from existing well-designed software, improve quality through documented and proven solutions to common problems, and apply design patterns effectively to improve the quality of software. Ashok has a holistic approach to teaching design patterns to students, explaining how they work together within the context of an application. “I give my students an initial design [based on a real-world application]. We look at the initial design, discuss the design problem and issues, look at case studies, and thenI ask them to improve the design pattern. Integrated into a holistic approach in which the context of an application is easy for the students to understand.” Ashok has been teaching design patterns for close to 30 years. Course Description",
