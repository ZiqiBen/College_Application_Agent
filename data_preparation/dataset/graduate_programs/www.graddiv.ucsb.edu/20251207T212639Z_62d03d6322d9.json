The diversity of research interests, perspectives, and expertise within the Department promotes the development of a broad foundation in ecology, evolution and marine biology, and the appreciation for interdisciplinary approaches to research. It also allows students to develop depth in specific sub-disciplines including population and community ecology, ecosystems ecology, limnology, and biological oceanography, ecological physiology, evolution, population genetics, climate science, and organismal biology. Faculty in the Department apply experimental (both field and laboratory-based) as well as modeling approaches and there are many opportunities for students to get involved in field work, outreach activities, and teaching.\nApplicants to the Department must be accepted by a major professor with whom they wish to work and who has agreed to supervise the student's graduate training and thesis dissertation research. Therefore, it is strongly encouraged that prospective students contact individual faculty members in the Program whose research interests coincide with their own and to list potential advisors on their application.
