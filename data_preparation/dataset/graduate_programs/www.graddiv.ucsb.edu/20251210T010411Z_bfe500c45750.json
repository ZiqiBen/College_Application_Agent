As the 21st century progresses, the science of biology is proving an increasingly deep and inspiring source of new concepts, mechanisms and materials for application across each of the traditional engineering disciplines. In synergistic parallel, the application of novel technologies and concepts emerging from these same engineering disciplines is rapidly advancing the science of biology. Taken together these two endeavors –engineering from biology and engineering for biology– comprise the discipline of bioengineering, a field that combines discoveries in the life sciences with the fundamental principles of engineering in furtherance of both.\nOur PhD degree in Biological Engineering provides students with formal training that unites UCSB strengths in engineering, biophysics, biochemistry, quantitative biology, and data sciences into a strong, coherent, forward-looking curriculum. All enrolled students will complete a unified core curriculum and also choose one of three focus areas: : (1) Computation, Modeling & Signal Processing, (2) Synthetic & Systems Biology, and (3) Cell, Tissue & Device Engineering.\nThe Biological Engineering PhD will train students in fundamental discovery, experimental methods, quantitative analysis, and technological design, innovation and application and prepare them for careers in all areas of biological engineering.\nMailing Address\nDepartment of Bioengineering\n1101 BioEngineering Building\nUniversity of California, Santa Barbara\nSanta Barbara, CA 93106-5170\n(USA)\nWebsite\nhttps://www.bioengineering.ucsb.edu\nEmail\nbioegradadvisor@bioengineering.ucsb.edu\nDepartment Phone Number\n805-893-4326\nDegrees Offered\nPhD\nDeadlines\nFall Only:\nDecember 5, 2025 (by 11:59 PM PST)\nRequirements\nOnline application\n:\nhttps://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/eapp\nStatement of Purpose, Personal History Statement, and Resume or CV (submitted in the online application)\nThree Letters of Recommendation (submitted online)\nOfficial transcripts from all post-secondary institutions attended (submitted online)\nEnglish Language Exam Scores (if applicable): TOEFL Internet-Based Test (IBT) total score of 80, or IELTS Overall Band score of 7, or Duolingo English Test total score of 120, or higher\nFinal/Official transcripts will be required for all applicants who are admitted and have indicated their intent to enroll at UC Santa Barbara by submitting a Statement of Intent to Register (SIR).
