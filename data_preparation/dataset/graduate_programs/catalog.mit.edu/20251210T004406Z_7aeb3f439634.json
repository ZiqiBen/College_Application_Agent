world, invent, and innovate with creative design. To address some of the greatest challenges of our time, the department uses approaches that range from basic scientific principles to complex engineering design, at scales from the nano to the global. Emphasizing the use of quantitative approaches, CEE features two vibrant centers of gravity: environment (what exists as natural systems) and infrastructure (what is created by human activity). The department is organized into two laboratories around these focus areas: the\nParsons Laboratory for Environmental Science and Engineering\nand the\nPierce Laboratory for Infrastructure Science and Engineering\n, which emphasizes materials and systems. CEE consists of people from a broad range of academic disciplines who work together to contribute to exciting intellectual networks across the department and MIT, solving tomorrow’s problems to build a better future through discovery and innovation.\nAn education in civil and environmental engineering provides an excellent foundation to solve the world’s greatest challenges in areas such as sustainability, environment, or energy. It prepares students for careers in fields as diverse as engineering design, education, law, medicine, and public health, as well as for graduate study in engineering and science. Graduates teach and carry out research in universities, work for large firms, start their own businesses, and hold leadership positions in government and nonprofit organizations. The department’s undergraduate program provides a solid background in science and engineering fundamentals while emphasizing hands-on design and research projects that provide real-world context. Students focus on the use of large data, computation, probability, and data analysis, and learn how to combine theory, experiments, and modeling to understand and solve complex science and engineering problems.\nCourse 1-ENG is the undergraduate degree program offered by The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. 1-ENG leads to a Bachelor of Science in General Engineering, and has a flexible curriculum that supplements a civil and environmental engineering foundation with an area of core coursework in a field of specialization, introducing exciting opportunities for disciplinary or multidisciplinary focus. This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of\nABET\n, under the commission's General Criteria with no applicable program criteria. CEE also offers a joint undergraduate degree program with Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences that focuses on the intersection of climate science and engineering solutions:\n1-12 Climate System Science and Engineering\n.\nThe department also offers graduate degrees within the broadly defined areas of environmental science and engineering (which includes environmental chemistry, environmental fluid mechanics, ecology, and hydrology and hydroclimatology), mechanics of materials and structures, transportation and systems engineering. The depth and breadth of coursework and research required differ for each degree program.\nThe department’s graduate degrees are as follows: Master of Engineering (MEng), Master of Science in Transportation (MST), Master of Science (SM), Civil Engineer, Environmental Engineer, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Science (ScD).\nBachelor of Science in Engineering (Course 1-ENG)\nBachelor of Science in Climate System Science and Engineering (1-12)\nMinor in Civil and Environmental Systems\nMinor in Civil Engineering\nMinor in Environmental Engineering Science\nUndergraduate Study\nThe Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers an undergraduate program, Course 1-ENG, leading to the Bachelor of Science in General Engineering.\nUndergraduates are encouraged to participate in the research activities of the department and in many cases obtain degree credit for such work. In general, students are encouraged to plan their programs for the third and fourth years so they dovetail with possible graduate study, including the department’s Master of Engineering degree. This is readily accomplished by those students who embark on the departmental program in their second year. Under certain circumstances, students are permitted to work toward receiving simultaneous undergraduate and graduate degrees.\nBachelor of Science in Engineering (Course 1-ENG)\nThe degree is designed to prepare students to make an impact in solving the world’s greatest challenges. The\nBachelor of Science in Engineering program\noffers the option to select a core and pursue tracks of study for in-depth exploration of particular areas, or to focus on cross-cutting, multidisciplinary studies within and outside the department in emerging areas of civil and environmental engineering, broadly defined. Refer to the website for further details on\nsample educational tracks and educational opportunities\n.\nThe undergraduate program provides significant flexibility through a track structure that is consistent with the diverse nature of our disciplinary groups and responsive to students' interests in new educational offerings. The program is built around a solid foundation in mathematics, big data, sensing, and computing, and is complemented by laboratory subjects on data analysis. It includes a capstone subject that provides ample opportunities for students to solve complex problems. The program enables students to design individualized programs to meet particular educational objectives. For example, students interested in careers in fields such as sustainability, environmental science and engineering, microbiology, sustainable materials, geochemistry, energy resources, structural/architectural engineering, oceanography, or environmental law can design programs that provide both depth and breadth.\nThe main component of the program is a small set of General Department Requirements (GDRs) consisting of subjects that focus on mathematics, computation, probability and statistics, and data analysis, plus a capstone. Students select one of three core options, each consisting of subjects that build a solid background in one of three areas: environment, mechanics and materials, or systems. Their selections of a core and a consistent set of four or five restricted elective subjects, in consultation with a CEE faculty advisor, define their track of undergraduate study. Restricted electives may be selected from subjects within or outside the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.\nTo satisfy the CI-M component of the Communication Requirement, students must take two of the department’s CI-M subjects (\n1.013\nand either\n1.101\n/\n1.104\nor\n1.106\n/\n1.107\n) or take one Course 1 CI-M subject and petition the Subcommittee on the Communication Requirement to substitute one CI-M from another science or engineering field. Any outside CI-M must fit into the coherent program of electives approved by the student’s academic advisor and must be approved by the undergraduate officer. The remaining part of the program consists of unrestricted electives, bringing the total number of required units beyond the General Institute Requirements to 180.\nBachelor of Science in Climate System Science and Engineering\nThe\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nand the\nDepartment of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences\noffer a joint undergraduate degree program leading to the\nBachelor of Science in Climate System Science and Engineering\n. A detailed description of the requirements can be found under the section on Interdisciplinary Programs.\nMinor in Civil and Environmental Systems\nThe Minor in Civil and Environmental Systems consists of the following subjects:\n1.020\nModeling and Decision-Making for Sustainability\n12\n1.022\nIntroduction to Network Models\n12\n1.041[J]\nTransportation: Foundations and Methods\n12\n1.075\nWater Resource Systems\n12\n1.101\nIntroduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering Design\n6\n1.102\nIntroduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering Design II\n6\nTotal Units\n60\nMinor in Civil Engineering\nThe Minor in Civil Engineering consists of the following subjects:\n1.035\nMechanics of Materials\n12\n1.036\nStructural Mechanics and Design\n12\n1.050\nSolid Mechanics\n12\n1.101\nIntroduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering Design\n6\n1.060\nFluid Mechanics\n12\n1.102\nIntroduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering Design II\n6\nTotal Units\n60\nMinor in Environmental Engineering Science\nThe Minor in Environmental Engineering Science consists of the following subjects:\n1.018[J]\nFundamentals of Ecology\n12\n1.060\nFluid Mechanics\n12\n1.061A\nTransport Processes in the Environment I\n6\n1.070A[J]\nIntroduction to Hydrology and Water Resources\n6\n1.080\nChemicals in the Environment\n12\n1.091\nTraveling Research Environmental eXperience (TREX): Fieldwork\n3\n1.106\nEnvironmental Fluid Mechanics Lab\n6\n1.107\nWater and Air Quality Laboratory\n6\nTotal Units\n63\nSubstitution of equivalent subjects offered by other departments is allowed, with permission of the minor advisor. However, at least three full 12-unit subjects must be Course 1 subjects.\nFor a\ngeneral description of the minor program\n, see Undergraduate Education.\nOther Undergraduate Opportunities Research Opportunities\nStudents wishing to work closely with a member of the faculty on research may obtain permission to enroll in\n1.UR\nResearch in Civil and Environmental Engineering\nor\n1.URG\nResearch in Civil and Environmental Engineering\n. The\nUndergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP)\noffers numerous possibilities, and the department awards several UROP traineeships to undergraduates each term.\nMaster of Engineering\nMaster of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering\nDoctoral Degrees\nGraduate Study\nGraduate students in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) participate in research with renowned faculty and get hands-on experience solving some of the world’s largest problems in the domains of infrastructure and environment, and related areas of interest. Education takes place inside and outside the classroom, and there are numerous opportunities to learn not only about civil and environmental engineering in an interdisciplinary research environment but also to network with peers. CEE grants the following advanced degrees: Master of Engineering in Civil and Environmental Engineering, Master of Science in Transportation, Master of Science, Civil Engineer, Environmental Engineer, Doctor of Science, and Doctor of Philosophy.\nThe Institute's general requirements for these degrees\nare described under Graduate Education.\nDetailed information on the departmental requirements for each degree\nmay be obtained on the CEE website.\nAdmission Requirements\nCEE seeks a diverse group of applicants from a range of academic disciplines who will work together to contribute to exciting intellectual networks across the department and Institute. Applicants whose first language is not English are required to submit scores from either the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), the preferred exam, or the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).\nEmail the department\nor\nvisit the CEE website\nto learn more about individual graduate programs.\nMaster of Engineering\nThe Master of Engineering (MEng) degree program offered by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering is a professional-oriented graduate program. The nine-month program consists of high-level, fast-paced coursework and significant engagement with real-world engineering projects. The program prepares graduates to address significant challenges in the domains of civil and environmental engineering through\nthree tracks of study\n: Climate, Environment, and Sustainability (CES), Data Science for Engineering Systems (DSES), and Structural Mechanics and Design. For current MIT undergraduates, the MEng program is a natural extension of a four-year Bachelor of Science degree, providing for practical experiences and preparing them for emerging fields in today’s job market. Graduates are well prepared for a professional career path or further graduate studies at MIT or elsewhere.\nEach track requires 66 units of coursework (48 units in Civil and Environmental Engineering subjects) and a 24 unit thesis. Students in the Climate, Environment, and Sustainability track take coursework to develop their understanding of CES and pursue research on CES topics across the breadth of civil and environmental engineering (e.g., ecological systems, air pollution, food, and energy).\nStudents in the Data Science for Engineering Systems track gain expertise in data science and computational modeling tools for improving the sustainability and resilience of next-generation societal-scale infrastructure systems. Students in this track choose an area of concentration—Computational Modeling and Design for Sustainability or Resilient Infrastructure Systems and Services—and engage in coursework, research, and specialized training that prepares them for careers in sustainable and resilient design of energy systems, materials and structures, supply chains, and urban systems.\nStudents in the Structural Mechanics and Design track engage in coursework and research in areas including structural engineering mechanics, computational design and optimization, and collaborative workflows at the interface of engineering and architecture.\nStudents in this MEng program are self-funded, and are responsible for paying tuition and cost-of-living expenses or securing external fellowships.\nMaster of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering\nThe\nMaster of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering\nis a two-year, research-intensive graduate degree designed for students who wish to deepen their expertise in a specialized area of civil and environmental engineering. The program culminates with the completion of a master’s thesis, which allows students to engage in original research and contribute new knowledge to the field.\nUnlike coursework-only professional master’s programs, the SM is structured around close collaboration with a faculty advisor. Students are admitted directly into a research group and matched with a faculty member whose work aligns with their interests and long-term goals. Together, the student and advisor design an individualized academic plan that includes advanced coursework, research activities, and professional development opportunities tailored to the student's aspirations and the focus of the research group.\nGraduates of the SM program are well prepared for advanced technical and research positions in industry, government, and academia. The degree also serves as an essential academic and research foundation for students who plan to continue on to doctoral study.\nWhile the Master of Science is most commonly earned en route to a PhD and is not typically considered a terminal degree, there are circumstances in which a standalone SM may be appropriate, such as for students pursuing specialized research interests or for those whose professional objectives do not require doctoral training.\nDoctoral Degrees\nThe\nDoctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering\nare research-centered doctoral programs that provide advanced training across the full spectrum of scholarship represented within the department. Doctoral students develop deep expertise in their chosen area of inquiry while gaining the intellectual flexibility and methodological skills needed to address complex challenges in the natural and built environment.\nThe program prepares students to generate new knowledge through original research, translate scientific discoveries into engineered solutions, and assume leadership roles in academia, industry, government, and interdisciplinary research settings. Coursework and research emphasize the application of fundamental scientific principles to engineering problems at multiple scales—from molecular processes to global systems.\nDoctoral research in the department spans a wide range of focus areas, including but not limited to: environmental chemistry; environmental fluid mechanics; ecology and evolution; hydrology and hydroclimatology; systems engineering, including networks and transportation; and materials, structures, and geomechanics.\nMany students enter the doctoral program having previously earned the Master of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering or a related field. In such cases, coursework completed as part of the SM degree may be applied toward doctoral subject requirements, subject to program guidelines and advisor approval.\nThe doctoral degree is awarded upon successful completion of all required coursework, formal acceptance and defense of a thesis proposal, and the submission and oral defense of a doctoral thesis that makes a significant and original contribution to the field.\nFinancial Assistance\nThe research of the department is an integral part of the graduate program. All doctoral students receive appointments as research or teaching assistants, as do the majority of our SM and MST students. Most of these appointments fully cover tuition, individual health insurance, and reasonable living expenses in the Cambridge area.\nApplicants are encouraged to apply for\ntraineeships and fellowships\noffered nationally by the National Science Foundation, NASA, DOE, and other governmental agencies that traditionally support students in the department. For an extensive list of such opportunities, visit the Office of Graduate Education website.\nInterdisciplinary Programs\nThrough its interdisciplinary programs, the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering brings together the science, technology, systems, and management skills necessary to deal with the important engineering problems of the future.\nComputational Science and Engineering\nMIT offers several\ninterdisciplinary graduate programs in computational science and engineering\n: the Master of Science in Computational Science and Engineering for students interested in the development, analysis, and application of computational approaches to science and engineering; the standalone Doctoral Program in Computational Science and Engineering, which offers specialization in fundamental, methodological aspects of computational science via focused coursework and a thesis; and the Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Computational Science and Engineering, which allows students to specialize in a computation-related field of their choice through focused coursework and a thesis through one of the participating host departments in the School of Engineering or School of Science.\nInformation on these programs is available under\nInterdisciplinary Graduate Programs\nand on the\nCenter for Computational Science and Engineering website\n.\nGraduate Programs in Transportation\nMIT provides a broad range of opportunities for transportation-related education. Courses and classes span the School of Engineering, the Sloan School of Management, and the School of Architecture and Planning, with many activities covering interdisciplinary topics that prepare students for future industry, government, or academic careers.\nA variety of\ngraduate degrees are available to students interested in transportation studies and research\n, including a Master of Science in Transportation and PhD in Transportation, described under Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs.\nLeaders for Global Operations\nThe 24-month\nLeaders for Global Operations (LGO)\nprogram combines graduate degrees in engineering and management for those with previous postgraduate work experience and strong undergraduate degrees in a technical field. During the two-year program, students complete a six-month internship at one of LGO's partner companies, where they conduct research that forms the basis of a dual-degree thesis. Students finish the program with two MIT degrees: an MBA (or SM in management) and an SM from one of eight engineering programs, some of which have optional or required LGO tracks. After graduation, alumni lead strategic initiatives in high-tech, operations, and manufacturing companies.\nJoint Program with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\nThe\nJoint Program with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)\nis intended for students whose primary career objective is oceanography or oceanographic engineering. Students divide their academic and research efforts between the campuses of MIT and WHOI. Joint Program students are assigned an MIT or WHOI faculty member as academic advisor; thesis research may be advised by MIT or WHOI faculty. Pre-candidacy, students are typically in residence at MIT.  Once they achieve candidacy, they are expected to live near the same campus as their advisor (MIT or WHOI). Students in the applied ocean science and engineering discipline follow a program similar to that of other students in their home department. MIT-WHOI Joint Program students in other disciplines follow the curriculum set out in their discipline's handbook. The\nprogram is described in more detail\nunder Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs.\nInquiries\nEmail for detailed information\nabout academic policies and programs,\nvisit the website\n, or visit the Academic Programs Office, Room 1-290, 617-253-9723.\nFaculty and Teaching Staff\nAli Jadbabaie, PhD\nJR East Professor of Engineering\nProfessor of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nHead, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nMember, Institute for Data, Systems, and Society\nProfessors\nEric J.

Undergraduates are encouraged to participate in the research activities of the department and in many cases obtain degree credit for such work. In general, students are encouraged to plan their programs for the third and fourth years so they dovetail with possible graduate study, including the department’s Master of Engineering degree. This is readily accomplished by those students who embark on the departmental program in their second year. Under certain circumstances, students are permitted to work toward receiving simultaneous undergraduate and graduate degrees. Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Course 1-ENG) The degree is designed to prepare students to make an impact in solving the world’s greatest challenges. The Bachelor of Science in Engineering program offers the option to select a core and pursue tracks of study for in-depth exploration of particular areas, or to focus on cross-cutting, multidisciplinary studies within and outside the department in emerging areas of civil and environmental engineering, broadly defined. Refer to the website for further details on sample educational tracks and educational opportunities . The undergraduate program provides significant flexibility through a track structure that is consistent with the diverse nature of our disciplinary groups and responsive to students' interests in new educational offerings. The program is built around a solid foundation in mathematics, big data, sensing, and computing, and is complemented by laboratory subjects on data analysis. It includes a capstone subject that provides ample opportunities for students to solve complex problems. The program enables students to design individualized programs to meet particular educational objectives.

It includes a capstone subject that provides ample opportunities for students to solve complex problems. The program enables students to design individualized programs to meet particular educational objectives. For example, students interested in careers in fields such as sustainability, environmental science and engineering, microbiology, sustainable materials, geochemistry, energy resources, structural/architectural engineering, oceanography, or environmental law can design programs that provide both depth and breadth. The main component of the program is a small set of General Department Requirements (GDRs) consisting of subjects that focus on mathematics, computation, probability and statistics, and data analysis, plus a capstone. Students select one of three core options, each consisting of subjects that build a solid background in one of three areas: environment, mechanics and materials, or systems. Their selections of a core and a consistent set of four or five restricted elective subjects, in consultation with a CEE faculty advisor, define their track of undergraduate study. Restricted electives may be selected from subjects within or outside the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. To satisfy the CI-M component of the Communication Requirement, students must take two of the department’s CI-M subjects ( 1.013 and either 1.101 / 1.104 or 1.106 / 1.107 ) or take one Course 1 CI-M subject and petition the Subcommittee on the Communication Requirement to substitute one CI-M from another science or engineering field. Any outside CI-M must fit into the coherent program of electives approved by the student’s academic advisor and must be approved by the undergraduate officer. The remaining part of the program consists of unrestricted electives, bringing the total number of required units beyond the General Institute Requirements to 180.

The program prepares graduates to address significant challenges in the domains of civil and environmental engineering through three tracks of study : Climate, Environment, and Sustainability (CES), Data Science for Engineering Systems (DSES), and Structural Mechanics and Design. For current MIT undergraduates, the MEng program is a natural extension of a four-year Bachelor of Science degree, providing for practical experiences and preparing them for emerging fields in today’s job market. Graduates are well prepared for a professional career path or further graduate studies at MIT or elsewhere. Each track requires 66 units of coursework (48 units in Civil and Environmental Engineering subjects) and a 24 unit thesis. Students in the Climate, Environment, and Sustainability track take coursework to develop their understanding of CES and pursue research on CES topics across the breadth of civil and environmental engineering (e.g., ecological systems, air pollution, food, and energy). Students in the Data Science for Engineering Systems track gain expertise in data science and computational modeling tools for improving the sustainability and resilience of next-generation societal-scale infrastructure systems. Students in this track choose an area of concentration—Computational Modeling and Design for Sustainability or Resilient Infrastructure Systems and Services—and engage in coursework, research, and specialized training that prepares them for careers in sustainable and resilient design of energy systems, materials and structures, supply chains, and urban systems. Students in the Structural Mechanics and Design track engage in coursework and research in areas including structural engineering mechanics, computational design and optimization, and collaborative workflows at the interface of engineering and architecture. Students in this MEng program are self-funded, and are responsible for paying tuition and cost-of-living expenses or securing external fellowships. Master of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering The Master of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering is a two-year, research-intensive graduate degree designed for students who wish to deepen their expertise in a specialized area of civil and environmental engineering. The program culminates with the completion of a master’s thesis, which allows students to engage in original research and contribute new knowledge to the field.

The program culminates with the completion of a master’s thesis, which allows students to engage in original research and contribute new knowledge to the field. Unlike coursework-only professional master’s programs, the SM is structured around close collaboration with a faculty advisor. Students are admitted directly into a research group and matched with a faculty member whose work aligns with their interests and long-term goals. Together, the student and advisor design an individualized academic plan that includes advanced coursework, research activities, and professional development opportunities tailored to the student's aspirations and the focus of the research group. Graduates of the SM program are well prepared for advanced technical and research positions in industry, government, and academia. The degree also serves as an essential academic and research foundation for students who plan to continue on to doctoral study. While the Master of Science is most commonly earned en route to a PhD and is not typically considered a terminal degree, there are circumstances in which a standalone SM may be appropriate, such as for students pursuing specialized research interests or for those whose professional objectives do not require doctoral training. Doctoral Degrees The Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering are research-centered doctoral programs that provide advanced training across the full spectrum of scholarship represented within the department. Doctoral students develop deep expertise in their chosen area of inquiry while gaining the intellectual flexibility and methodological skills needed to address complex challenges in the natural and built environment. The program prepares students to generate new knowledge through original research, translate scientific discoveries into engineered solutions, and assume leadership roles in academia, industry, government, and interdisciplinary research settings. Coursework and research emphasize the application of fundamental scientific principles to engineering problems at multiple scales—from molecular processes to global systems. Doctoral research in the department spans a wide range of focus areas, including but not limited to: environmental chemistry; environmental fluid mechanics; ecology and evolution; hydrology and hydroclimatology; systems engineering, including networks and transportation; and materials,",

Doctoral research in the department spans a wide range of focus areas, including but not limited to: environmental chemistry; environmental fluid mechanics; ecology and evolution; hydrology and hydroclimatology; systems engineering, including networks and transportation; and materials, structures, and geomechanics. Many students enter the doctoral program having previously earned the Master of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering or a related field. In such cases, coursework completed as part of the SM degree may be applied toward doctoral subject requirements, subject to program guidelines and advisor approval. The doctoral degree is awarded upon successful completion of all required coursework, formal acceptance and defense of a thesis proposal, and the submission and oral defense of a doctoral thesis that makes a significant and original contribution to the field. Financial Assistance The research of the department is an integral part of the graduate program. All doctoral students receive appointments as research or teaching assistants, as do the majority of our SM and MST students. Most of these appointments fully cover tuition, individual health insurance, and reasonable living expenses in the Cambridge area. Applicants are encouraged to apply for traineeships and fellowships offered nationally by the National Science Foundation, NASA, DOE, and other governmental agencies that traditionally support students in the department.

Students may attend departmental orientation programs to talk with faculty and others with experience in fields of potential interest. They should select electives that will help them think about possible majors. The Independent Activities Period (IAP) in January, described later in this section, provides students with opportunities to investigate different fields. For many students, this consideration of fields will reinforce existing convictions, while for others it will open up new avenues of interest. MIT may, however, limit enrollment in particular fields of study to balance resources with student interest. Each student entering MIT is assigned an advisor who assists the student in designing an effective program of study. The selection of elective subjects is an important consideration, one that students should discuss in depth with their advisors. All undergraduate degree programs combine the study of basic principles with practical applications. This combination helps to motivate the lifelong learning necessary for professional competence. Students usually choose a Course (major) at the end of the first year, though they need not do so until the end of the second year. There is sufficient overlap and flexibility so that selection or change of Course can be made with relative ease in the second year. All undergraduate and graduate academic programs, as well as faculty listings for each of the Institute's departments, are described fully in Schools and College and Interdisciplinary Programs . Information on undergraduate registration may be found in Academic Procedures and Institute Regulations . Electives Electives may be used for several different purposes. For example, students who are undecided about their eventual majors may decide to use some portion of their electives to explore the various departments or fields they are considering. Students more certain of their academic and professional goals may choose to use electives to explore areas of secondary interest. Still other students focus first on departmental or General Institute Requirements, deferring subjects of a more supplemental nature until a later year. The study of a language may also be started or continued. First-year students should select electives that best suit their individual needs. There are several hundred subjects without prerequisites that are especially appropriate for first-year students.",

There are several hundred subjects without prerequisites that are especially appropriate for first-year students. However, in general, any subject offered by the Institute is open to all students, provided they satisfy the prerequisites. Double Majors Students may earn a bachelor's degree with up to two majors by successfully completing the GIRs and the departmental requirements for each major. To add a second major, a student must apply to the Committee on Curricula (CoC) by Add Date of their penultimate term. Applications submitted after this deadline will be considered by the CoC at its discretion on a case-by-case basis. A double major program should be completed in eight to 10 academic terms and should be planned in advance. A student's plan for completing both majors must be outlined in the application to the CoC. The application must also include the expected completion date for the degree, and it must be approved by both programs. Students should consult Student Financial Services regarding any impact that pursuing a double major might have on their eligibility for MIT or federal financial aid, particularly if they anticipate needing more than eight semesters to complete their studies. Students must select a second major in a different area from the primary major. Students pursuing a double major may also complete up to two minors, but a minor may not be taken in the same area as either of the major programs. Only registered undergraduates who have completed at least three terms at MIT, including at least one term with a declared major, may apply. Transfer students must complete at least two terms at MIT, including at least one term with a declared major. Students with cumulative averages below 4.0 will be considered by the CoC on a case-by-case basis. A student who has previously earned a bachelor's degree with a single major may not return to complete a second major. For",

Graduate programs are described in individual department statements, and in the Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs section . Each graduate student is officially enrolled in a degree program. The programs are not limited, however, to subjects offered in a single department. Subjects and research programs may be chosen from several departments, given the approval of the departmental faculty advisor to ensure that the overall program is integrated and well balanced with respect to a major field of study. A student who expects to come to MIT for an advanced degree after earning an undergraduate degree elsewhere should give careful attention to undergraduate prerequisites as outlined by each department or program elsewhere in this catalog. For more specific information, a student should consult the department or program in which they wish to enroll. MIT degrees are \"residence\" degrees in the sense that a major portion of the work must be done on campus in association with the faculty, other graduate students, and the Institute community. The amount of time required to attain any one degree varies. Master's Degree Master of Science With and Without Specification For the degree of Master of Science, the student must have satisfactorily completed a program of study of at least 66 units of graduate subject credit and a thesis approved by the department in which they are enrolled. If 34 units and the thesis are in a single approved program, as determined by a departmental committee on graduate students, the degree will be recommended with specification in this program; otherwise, the degree",

If 34 units and the thesis are in a single approved program, as determined by a departmental committee on graduate students, the degree will be recommended with specification in this program; otherwise, the degree will be recommended without specification. The same high standard of academic performance in a program approved by a departmental committee on graduate students is required for either degree. The choice of area of specialization must be approved by the committee on graduate students of the department in which the student is enrolled. Approval of the entire program must be obtained from this committee and from the student's faculty advisor. A special interdepartmental committee, approved by the Office of Graduate Education, may be appointed to supervise a program of study in an interdisciplinary field. The satisfactory completion of the master's degree requires the student to be in residence as a full-time regular graduate student for a minimum of one regular academic term (not the summer session). Every degree candidate working on a thesis must register for thesis in all terms during which their thesis research or writing is actually in progress and during the term in which their name appears on the degree list. Master of Architecture For the degree of Master of Architecture, the student must have completed satisfactorily a program of study of at least 282 units of graduate subject credit and a thesis, both acceptable to the Department of Architecture. The program requires three and one-half academic years of residence. Advanced entry may be considered for students with a pre-professional bachelor’s degree in architecture.

Simultaneous Registration for Two Master's Degrees Single thesis. This degree plan is intended for qualified graduate students who seek academic recognition in two professional fields that, although distinct, have a substantial intellectual connection. The degree plan requires a balanced choice of academic subjects, made with the advice of each of two departments, and by selection of the thesis topic. To satisfy the minimum requirements for the program, the student must complete (in addition to thesis units) at least 132 units of subject credit, of which 66 units are unique to each department. In those instances where a department or program has established unit requirements in excess of the foregoing minimums, the department or program requirements prevail. Such excess of units in one department may not be applied to the program in the other department. A student pursuing a Master in City Planning in addition to a second master's degree must have both programs approved in the usual way, but the subject units for the Master in City Planning can be lowered at the discretion of the Department of Urban Studies and Planning. The dual-degree Leaders for Global Operations program confers both an MBA from the Sloan School of Management and an SM from one of seven engineering programs.

Students may submit a single thesis provided it is acceptable to the graduate committees of each program. It is expected that such dual degree candidates will be in residence at least one term longer than expected if enrolled in a single degree program. In order to be eligible to participate in a dual degree program, students must meet the admissions criteria of both departments. At least two regular terms prior to completion of the program, the student must submit to each department a statement of educational objectives along with a detailed program plan that includes a description of the proposed thesis topic. The total program must meet with the approval of each department, and a petition approved by the Office of Graduate Education describing the program must be filed with the Registrar's Office.

Such a request can be initiated by a petition approved by both departments and approved by the Office of Graduate Education. Simultaneous Award of Bachelor's and Master's Degrees An undergraduate student of the Institute who is enrolled as a candidate for the bachelor’s degree may be admitted by a department as a candidate for the master’s degree. Students must register as graduate students for at least one regular academic term (not the summer session) to be recommended for the simultaneous award of the bachelor’s and master’s degrees. The thesis submitted for the master’s degree may also be accepted by the department in fulfillment of the undergraduate thesis requirement, if any. A student wishing to pursue this type of academic program must apply for graduate admission in the usual way. Once a student is classified as a graduate student by the Institute, their eligibility for certain financial aid programs will change. US citizens who are graduate students, and who are enrolled at least half time, are eligible to apply for several types of Title IV federal loans. The interest rates, subsidy rules and origination fees may be different than those for undergraduate students. Graduate students are not eligible for MIT scholarship funds from Student Financial Services. International students who are graduate students may apply for MIT Loans. More information about graduate financial aid as well as instructions and application forms can be found on the Student Financial Services website. Undergraduate students eligible for a simultaneous degree are entitled to remain in undergraduate housing on the condition that they are within their “eight-term maximum” housing guarantee. Otherwise, ninth-term undergraduate students must apply to the graduate housing waiting list. Engineer's Degree The program for an engineer's degree requires more advanced and broader competence in",

Otherwise, ninth-term undergraduate students must apply to the graduate housing waiting list. Engineer's Degree The program for an engineer's degree requires more advanced and broader competence in engineering and science subjects than for the master's degree, but with less emphasis on original research than a doctoral program. In general, the engineer's degree requires two academic years beyond an undergraduate degree. The following engineer's degrees are awarded: Civil Engineer (CE) Electrical Engineer (EE) Engineer in Aeronautics and Astronautics (EAA) Engineer in Computer Science (ECS) Environmental Engineer (EnvE) Materials Engineer (MatE) Mechanical Engineer (MechE) Naval Engineer (NavE) Nuclear Engineer (NuclE) The requirement for such a degree is the satisfactory completion of a program of advanced study and research approved by the appropriate department or interdepartmental committee of the School of Engineering. The minimum program consists of at least 162 subject units (exclusive of thesis units) and the completion of an acceptable thesis. The candidate must also have been in residence for a minimum of two regular academic terms. Every degree candidate working on a thesis is expected to register for thesis in all periods during which the thesis research or writing is actually in progress and during the term their name appears on the degree list. A department may accept a master's thesis of superior quality for the engineer's degree only if the student intends to use that document to fulfill the requirements of a single master's degree. Doctoral Degree Doctoral degrees are offered by various departments and programs within each of MIT's five schools and the Schwarzman College of Computing; see each school's description for the lists of degrees. A list of the interdisciplinary graduate degrees offered at MIT , including those offered by the MIT-Harvard Health Sciences and Technology Program and the Joint Program with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is available in the section on Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs.

      "text": "to fulfill the requirements of a single master's degree. Doctoral Degree Doctoral degrees are offered by various departments and programs within each of MIT's five schools and the Schwarzman College of Computing; see each school's description for the lists of degrees. A list of the interdisciplinary graduate degrees offered at MIT , including those offered by the MIT-Harvard Health Sciences and Technology Program and the Joint Program with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is available in the section on Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs. MIT offers the degrees of Doctor of Science and Doctor of Philosophy interchangeably in the engineering and science departments (except biology and brain and cognitive sciences) and from the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology Program. These degrees certify creditable completion of an approved program of advanced study in addition to a research dissertation of high quality based on original research. The two Institute requirements for a doctorate are completion of a program of advanced study, including a general examination, and completion and oral defense of a thesis on original research. The course of advanced study and research leading to the doctorate must be pursued under the direction of the departmental committee on graduate students for at least four academic terms. In some cases, the required period of residence may be reduced, but in no instance can it be reduced to less than two regular academic terms and one summer session. A student is enrolled in a program of advanced study and research approved by the department. The thesis research is in this same area, but the program often includes subjects reaching into several departments. If the field requires substantial participation by two or more departments, an interdepartmental faculty committee, approved by the Office of Graduate Education, should be appointed to supervise the student's program. Each doctoral candidate must take a general examination in their program of study at such time and in such manner as the departmental or interdepartmental committee approves. This examination consists of both oral and written parts. Nonresident Doctoral Thesis Research Status Thesis research is ordinarily done in residence at the Institute. However, on some occasions, it may be essential or desirable that the student be absent from the campus during a portion of thesis research or writing. Nonresident doctoral thesis research status allows thesis research to be carried out while not in formal residence at the Institute. Nonresident status is intended for doctoral students who",

However, on some occasions, it may be essential or desirable that the student be absent from the campus during a portion of thesis research or writing. Nonresident doctoral thesis research status allows thesis research to be carried out while not in formal residence at the Institute. Nonresident status is intended for doctoral students who have completed all requirements other than the thesis. Permission to become a nonresident doctoral candidate must be obtained from the Office of Graduate Education at least one month prior to Registration Day of the term during which the student wishes to register in this category (a fee will be assessed for late requests). A student who is permitted to undertake nonresident thesis research must register as a nonresident doctoral candidate and pay a substantially reduced tuition. For the first three regular academic terms, tuition is approximately 5 percent of regular full tuition. Thereafter, it is charged at approximately 15 percent. For only the first three semesters of nonresident status, a student may receive fellowship support from MIT (or from an external funding source, with MIT acting as administrator) for an amount that is no more than 5 percent of tuition per semester. The intention of the fellowship is to cover reduced tuition charged to students approved for this status. Departments and programs may, at their discretion and depending upon availability of funds, cover student health insurance for the duration of the nonresident period, including after the first three semesters. Students experiencing unexpected financial emergencies and students with children may be eligible to receive financial assistance during the nonresident period . Eligibility for federal loans and sponsored billing remain unaffected for the length of nonresident tenure. Nonresident doctoral candidates have limited access to the facilities and academic life of the Institute. However, they are permitted access to the libraries and athletic facilities, and may be eligible to use office, design studio, laboratory, or computer facilities of the Institute. Nonresident doctoral candidates also have the same student health privileges and options as resident students upon payment of the health insurance premiums.

Consult the Office of Graduate Education or see Graduate Policies and Procedures for additional information on nonresident status. Minor Program Although there is no Institute requirement of a minor for the doctoral degree, certain departments require that candidates take a number of subjects outside their major field. Language Proficiency There is no Institute language requirement; however, several departments require that a candidate be able to read or speak a second or third language with intermediate competence. A student may satisfy the requirement in one of three ways: by fulfilling the requirement before entrance by passing one or more intermediate or advanced subjects with a grade of C or better; through examination by MIT Global Languages; or by taking language subjects offered by MIT Global Languages or its affiliated cross-registration partners according to the requirements of the candidate's home department. Normally, introductory subjects in a language cannot be used to satisfy a requirement for language proficiency. MIT Global Languages offers a variety of intermediate and advanced language subjects, stressing the ability to read and speak in Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, or Spanish. For the purpose of meeting the requirement through examination, MIT Global Languages gives written examinations each semester prior to pre-registration (November and April) in any language offered at MIT. If a candidate wishes to be examined in a language not offered at MIT, the candidate's home department will have to arrange for this examination.
