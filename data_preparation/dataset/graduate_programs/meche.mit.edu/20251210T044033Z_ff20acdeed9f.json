It seeks to provide, in the \natmosphere of a professional school, the widest possible opportunity for advanced study \nand investigation and for intimate association among workers whose common objective is \nto extend the boundaries of their profession. \n \nAll incoming graduate students are encouraged to take the seminar subject 2.991 \nIntroduction to Graduate Study in Mechanical Engineering that introduces students to \nvarious aspects of graduate student life in the MechE Department, MIT, and the Boston \narea. It meets for 1 hour each week during the Fall term. Students who do not have a \nconfirmed research advisor by Registration Day, and students whose research advisors \nare based outside the MIT campus (e.g. a hospital or Draper Labs), are required to take \nthis seminar class. \n \nThe Mechanical Engineering (MechE) Department offers the following graduate \ndegrees: \n \n1. Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (SMME) \n2. Master of Science in Ocean Engineering (SMOE) \n3. Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering (SMNAME) \n4. Master of Science in Oceanographic Engineering (SMOGE, joint MIT/WHOI \ndegree) \n5. Master of Engineering in Manufacturing (MEng) \n6. Mechanical Engineer's degree \n7. Naval Engineer's degree \n8. Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) or Doctor of Science (ScD), which differ in name \nonly (this includes the joint MIT/WHOI doctoral degrees) \n \nA Master of Science degree is the first graduate degree offered in MechE. It is awarded \nfor the completion of a program of advanced study, together with a thesis that is considered \nto be the centerpiece of a student’s graduate experience. \n \nThe Master of Engineering in Manufacturing is a one-year professional degree program \nthat prepares the student to assume a role of technical leadership in the manufacturing \nindustries. \n \nThe Mechanical Engineer’s degree offers preparation for a career in advanced \nengineering practice. It does so through a program of advanced coursework that goes well \nbeyond the Master’s level. This degree is not a stepping-stone toward the PhD. \n \nThe Doctor of Philosophy (or Science) is the highest academic degree offered. It is \n\n \n4 \nawarded for the completion of a program of advanced study and a significant original \nthesis. \n \nIn what follows, we describe how students can gain entry to the MechE graduate \nprograms (sections 2 and 3) and what they must accomplish to obtain the various degrees \n(sections 4–9). Section 10 describes some of the means available at MIT to provide \nfinancial support to graduate students. It also describes the rules for off-campus research. \n \nA list of the key dates on the MIT academic calendar can be found here. It includes \nadd/drop dates, degree application deadlines, and the dates by which theses must be \nsubmitted. \n \n2 Entrance Requirements \nApplications to the Mechanical Engineering (MechE) Graduate Program are accepted \nfrom persons who have completed, or will have completed by the time they arrive, a \nBachelor’s degree. Most incoming students will have a degree in mechanical engineering \nor ocean engineering. However, the Department’s admission criteria are not specific in this \nregard, and talented students with backgrounds in other branches of engineering or in \nscience may gain entry. \n \nTo qualify for a graduate degree, applicants are expected to have at least an \nundergraduate-level exposure to most of the core MechE disciplines (solid mechanics, \ndynamics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, materials, control, design and \nmanufacturing), and to be familiar with basic electric circuits and electromagnetic field \ntheory. Those who are deemed deficient may be asked to make up courses in certain areas \nbefore they graduate. The make-up courses may be at the undergraduate-level (in which \ncase they are relatively elementary and usually cannot be applied toward graduate credit), \nor at the graduate-level (in which case they carry graduate credit). \n \n3 Admission \nThe method to apply to the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Program is via our online \nsystem. See http://meche.mit.edu/academic/graduate/applying/ for more information. \n \nAll official transcripts must be submitted directly to the MechE Graduate Office, Room \n1-112, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA \n02139 but only after the student has been admitted. All electronic transcripts should be \nsubmitted to megradoffice@mit.edu. \n \nThe processing of applications for graduate study is done entirely by the Department. \nThe MechE Graduate Admissions Officer, together with a faculty committee, reviews all \napplications, rank-orders them, and admits the number of applicants that the Department \nexpects it can accommodate. \n \nForeign nationals applying from abroad may be admitted, but must meet all visa \nrequirements (see OGE’s website for details) including securing full financial support for at \n\n \n5 \nleast the first year in order to register at MIT. This typically comes in the form of a research \nor teaching assistantship from an individual MIT professor (Section 10 describes how to \nseek such support), though for some foreign students this support comes from their family, \ntheir government, or an international fellowship. \n \n        Applicants to the graduate program are required to take the general GRE test (Institute \nCode 3514). Applicants from non-English-speaking countries are also required to take the \nIELTS, (preferred), or the TOEFL exam; the Duolingo English Test (DET) will also be \naccepted for the upcoming admissions cycle (Fall 2026 matriculation). Candidates whose \ncitizenship is from India are exempt from taking the IELTS, TOEFL, or DET exam. The \nminimum acceptable score for the IELTS exam is 7.0, for the TOEFL exam it is 100 (ibt), \nand for the DET it is 135. Note, we accept the Academic IELTS only (not General \nTraining). \n \nApplications are due by December 15 of the previous year and decisions are released \non or around February 15. \n \n4 Writing Ability Requirement \nAll incoming graduate students must demonstrate satisfactory English writing ability, \nor successfully complete appropriate training in writing. This requirement reflects the \nfaculty’s conviction that writing is an essential skill for an engineer with an advanced \ndegree. This also applies to dual degree candidates. \n \nThe MechE Department requires all incoming graduate students, native as well as \nforeign, to take the Institute’s Graduate Writing Examination. This exam is administered \nin the summer before matriculation (http://cmsw.mit.edu/graduate-writing-exam/). \nDepending on the results, a student will either (a) pass the writing ability requirement, (b) \nbe required to take a relatively short, but intensive, seminar-workshop in expository writing \n(21W.794 Technical Writing Workshop) during the Independent Activities Period in \nJanuary, or (c) be required to take a course in writing. Several courses suitable for \nengineers and scientists are offered at MIT, and special courses are available for those for \nwhom English is a second language. \n \nIn addition, MIT requires that all graduate students for whom English has not been the \nlanguage of instruction in both elementary and secondary school take an English \nEvaluation Test. This test is separate from the aforementioned Graduate Writing \nExamination required by the Department. See https://mitgsl.mit.edu/academics- \ncourses/english-evaluation-test-eet for more details. \n \n5 Master of Science (SM) Degrees \nThe requirements for the Master of Science degrees offered by the Department pertain \nto (1) writing ability, (2) credit units, (3) thesis, and (4) a distribution requirement in the \ncase of the three Ocean-related Master’s degrees. The SMME degree does not have a \ndistribution requirement. The specific requirements are as follows: \n\n \n6 \n \n5.1 Writing ability \n \nStudents must successfully fulfill the writing ability requirement described in Section \n4. \n \n5.2 Credit units \n \n• Students must successfully complete at least 72 graduate-level credit units of \ncoursework, not including credit received for (a) 2.S981 (if taken) and (b) thesis \nwork. Following approval by the Graduate Officer and the Institute, certain \nadvanced undergraduate subjects that go beyond the MIT MechE Department's \nundergraduate degree requirements may be used to satisfy up to 24 units of graduate \ncredit. The Institute requires such subjects to be upgraded to graduate level by \ncompleting additional work that needs to be certified by an instructor of a graduate \nsubject as sufficient for obtaining credit towards that subject. Approval should be \nsought prior to taking such subjects. \n \n• The program is expected to include at least three 12-unit graduate-level MechE \nDepartment subjects. Upon approval by the Graduate Officer, up to one special \nsubject can be used to satisfy this requirement. Approval should be sought prior to \ntaking a special subject. \n \n• Students must take at least one graduate-level mathematics subject (12 units) \noffered by MIT’s Mathematics Department. No waivers are allowed. \n \n• A minimum grade point average of 3.5 (A=5, B=4, C=3, D=2, F=0) must be \nmaintained in graduate school. No credit will be awarded for subjects taken on \nP/D/F basis. Credit for classes taken under the special grading policy announced \nfor the Spring and Fall of 2020 will be awarded in accordance with Institute \nregulations. Up to a maximum of 12 units of subject 2.989 (Experiential Learning \nin Mechanical Engineering) may be counted towards the 72-unit credit \nrequirement. \n \n• Students are allowed to transfer credit toward their Master’s degree from graduate \nsubjects taken previously at MIT or another accredited institution, and not used as \npart of the credits required for an undergraduate or graduate degree. The limit is \n24 credit units if the subjects were taken outside MIT. Transferred subjects must \nhave a grade of B or higher. No thesis units may be transferred. \n \n5.3 Thesis \n \nIn the MechE Department, the thesis is considered to be the centerpiece of a student’s \ngraduate experience. The student must complete an acceptable SM thesis under the \nsupervision of an MIT faculty member or a Senior/Principal Research Scientist/Engineer \nwho holds an appointment in the MechE Department. The thesis is an original work of \nresearch, design, or development. The supervisor signs and accepts the thesis upon \ncompletion. \n\n \n7 \n \nIf the supervisor is not a member of the MechE Department, a reader who belongs to \nthe MechE Department faculty must also endorse the thesis. \n \nEntering Master’s degree candidates \n \n• must notify the MechE Graduate Office, Room 1-112, of their thesis supervisor \nwithin six weeks of registration, and \n• must submit a completed thesis by a due date set by MIT, typically no later than \none week before the beginning of the examination period. All key dates can be \nfound here. \n \n5.4 Distribution Requirements for Ocean-related master’s degrees \n \n• Master of Science in Ocean Engineering (SMOE). A graduate subject in each \nof the following areas is required: (i) Marine Hydrodynamics (2.20); (ii) a subject \nthat emphasizes professional practice in ocean environment, such as Design \nPrinciples for Ocean Vehicles (2.22); and (iii) a subject in Acoustics and Sensing \n(e.g., 2.066), or Structural Mechanics (e.g., 2.080J), or Structural Dynamics (e.g., \n2.060J). \n \n• Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering (SMNAME). \nA graduate subject in each of the following areas is required: (i) Marine \nHydrodynamics (2.20 or a more advanced subject) and (ii) at least 24 units in their \narea of concentration. (Background requirements in Introduction to Naval \nArchitecture (e.g., 2.701) and Ship Power and Propulsion (e.g., 2.611) can be \nwaived if previously taken as an undergraduate; otherwise, these subjects need to \nbe taken at MIT.) \n \n• Master of Science in Oceanographic Engineering (SMOGE): The MIT/WHOI \nJoint Program Handbook for Oceanographic Engineering lists the requirements for \nthis degree. (Please see http://mit.whoi.edu/handbooks for the current handbook.) \n \n*  *  * \n \nA typical Master’s degree consists of six twelve-unit subjects plus a thesis, and is \nexpected to take a full-time student approximately 2 years (4 regular semesters and the \nintervening summer and IAP periods) to complete. Students with a research assistantship \nwill not be able to finish in less than 1.5 years because of the limitation on the number of \nsubjects they are allowed to take per term (see Section 10). At the same time, there is no \nreason, other than the uncertainties or requirements of research, why they should take \nlonger. \n \nThe Master’s thesis is essentially a research (or development, or design) apprenticeship \nunder a faculty supervisor, and as such is usually the major contributor to the student’s \nprofessional maturation. Incoming students are urged to find a thesis project and supervisor \nwithout undue delay. There are several reasons for avoiding delay. The SM thesis is a \nsubstantial piece of work and takes time to mature. A student who begins thesis work \n\n \n8 \nassociates him/herself not only with a faculty member, but usually also with a research \ngroup or laboratory where s/he meets other faculty and experienced graduate students from \nwhom to learn and get good advice. It is usually a mistake to think that the degree can be \nattained more efficiently by taking the coursework first, and putting off the thesis work to \nthe last term. \n \nA student’s thesis supervisor usually also serves as the academic advisor. If the thesis \nsupervisor is not a MechE Department faculty member, the student should seek academic \nadvice from an MechE faculty member whose research interests are close to his/her own \n(such as the departmental thesis reader), or from the Graduate Officer. \n \n5.5 Double SM Degrees \n \nStudents registered in another engineering department at MIT who wish to earn a \nMaster of Science in Mechanical Engineering, Ocean Engineering, Naval Architecture and \nMarine Engineering, or Oceanographic Engineering simultaneously with a Master’s degree \nwith specification in their own department may do so by satisfying both departments’ \nrequirements, with the credit unit requirements satisfied separately, but with a common \nthesis. Such programs of study must be approved in advance by the Graduate Officers \nof both the departments involved. All incoming graduate students must demonstrate \nsatisfactory English writing ability, or successfully complete appropriate training in \nwriting. This requirement reflects the faculty’s conviction that writing is an essential skill \nfor an engineer with an advanced degree. This also applies to dual degree candidates. A \nstudent who had previously applied for, but was denied, admission to the MIT MechE \nDepartment is not eligible to get a dual degree from the MechE Department. The \nDepartment’s procedural requirements are the following: (i) A petition for the dual \nmaster’s degree in the MechE Department must be filled out, and adhered to. The student \nmust be admissible to the MechE Department. (ii) The student must select a MechE faculty \nmember as a thesis reader. That faculty member must accept this responsibility by signing \nthe petition. (iii) Items (i) and (ii) must be completed well in advance of thesis completion, \nbut no later than June 1 of the year before the student expects to graduate.  \n \nCompletion of a double SM degree in Mechanical Engineering does not imply \nadmission to the MechE department. Students who want to pursue any other degree in the \nDepartment must follow the normal application route for that particular program. The \npreceding also applies to students registered in Mechanical Engineering who wish to earn \nan SMME degree simultaneously with one of the Ocean-Engineering Master’s degrees \noffered by the Department. In this case item (ii) above is modified as follows: the MechE \nfaculty member who serves as the thesis advisor must accept this responsibility by a letter \nto the MechE Graduate Officer, and ensure that all requirements for the dual degree are \nmet. \n \n6 Master of Engineering (MEng) in Manufacturing \nThe Master of Engineering in Manufacturing is a one-year professional degree program \nthat is intended to prepare the student to assume a role of technical leadership in the \n\n \n9 \nmanufacturing industries. The degree educates practitioners to become leaders in existing \nand emerging manufacturing companies. The requirements for this degree are usually \ncompleted in one year and include the following (1) advanced writing ability, (2) an \nintegrated set of core lecture/laboratory-based subjects for a total of 87 credit units, (3) a \nprofessional seminar, and (4) a 24-unit summer thesis project which also requires at least \n3 units of work during the fall semester. \nA minimum grade point average of 3.5 must be maintained in graduate school. No \ncredit will be awarded for subjects taken on a P/D/F basis. Credit for classes taken under \nthe special grading policy announced for the Spring or Fall of 2020 will be awarded in \naccordance with Institute regulations. \n \nThe requirements for this degree are outlined below in sections 6.1 through 6.4 in more \ndetail. Exceptions and substitutions can be made only with prior approval of the MEng in \nAdvanced Manufacturing and Design Program Office. Only deviations that meet the \nminimum of 87 units of coursework, 3 thesis units during the fall semester and 24 units of \nthesis units during the summer will be considered. \n \n6.1 Writing ability \n \nStudents must successfully fulfill the writing ability requirement described in Section \n4. \n \n6.2 Core subject areas (84 units) \n \nManufacturing Physics (24 units): 2.810 Manufacturing Processes and Systems and \n2.830 Process Optimization and Control. \n \nManufacturing Systems (24 units): 2.854 Introduction to Manufacturing Systems; \n15.762J (ESD.267J) Supply Chain Planning and 15.763J (ESD.268J) Manufacturing \nSystem and Supply Chain Design. \n \nBusiness Fundamentals (12 units): 2.961 Management in Engineering. \nProduct Design (12 units): 2.739J Product Design and Development or 2.744 Product \nDesign. \n \nRestricted Elective (12 units): 2.120 Introduction to Robotics or 2.171 Analysis and \nDesign of Digital Control Systems or 2.675 Micro/Nano Engineering Laboratory or \n2.740 Bio-inspired Robotics or 2.76 Global Engineering or 2.821J Selection and \nProcessing of Structural Materials or 15.871 Introduction to System Dynamics or \n15.872 System Dynamics II. \n \n6.3 Professional Seminar in Global Manufacturing Innovation and Entrepreneur- \nship (3 units) \n \n6.4 Thesis Project (3-12 units in the fall and 24 units in the summer) \n \nThe thesis project is intended to give each student experience in a manufacturing- \n\n \n10 \nrelated organization, working on problems with both strategic breadth and technical depth. \nIt is an integrating experience pulling together the diverse topics treated in the classes. The \nprojects will explore innovations in technology, systems, and business strategy. \n \nMost MIT theses, including MEng theses, are written by a single author. However, \nsome industry projects lend themselves better to joint collaborative research. Permission \nto undertake a joint thesis must be obtained well in advance of the September degree \napplication deadline from the MEng Program office and then from the Vice-Chancellor or \nhis/her designee. The request for approval for a joint thesis should be submitted to the \nOffice of Graduate Education via the general petition process. To be accepted upon \ncompletion, the title page of the joint thesis should bear the signatures of all authors and \nthesis supervisors. \n \nAdmission to the MEng program does not imply admission to the MechE SM/PhD \nprogram. The latter requires a complete application during the regular admissions process. \n \n7 Mechanical Engineer’s Degree \nThe Mechanical Engineer’s degree provides an opportunity for further study beyond \nthe Master’s level. This degree emphasizes breadth of knowledge in mechanical \nengineering and its economic and social implications; it is not a stepping-stone toward the \nPhD. There is no direct admission process to the Mechanical Engineer’s degree; students \nadmitted to the MechE SM and PhD programs are eligible to pursue this degree. \n \nThe overall course of study and thesis must comprise a coherent program in \nMechanical Engineering. The candidate is required to prepare a plan of study and to submit \nit to the MechE Graduate Office for approval by the Engineer’s Degree Coordinator, \nProfessor Jung-Hoon Chun. The student will be considered a Mechanical Engineer’s \nDegree candidate when this plan is approved. \n \nThe Engineer’s degree has four requirements: (1) writing ability, (2) a program of \ncoursework, (3) a thesis, and (4) an oral presentation. These are described below. \n \n7.1 Writing ability \n \nStudents must successfully fulfill the writing ability requirement described in Section \n4. \n \n7.2 Program of coursework \n \nThe requirements are as follows: \n \n• 162 graduate-level credit units (including credited units taken during the Master's \ndegree program and no more than 12 units of credit received for thesis work done \nunder 2.999 (see below)). No credit will be awarded for subjects taken on P/D/F \nbasis. Credit for classes taken under the special grading policy announced for the \nSpring or Fall of 2020 will be awarded in accordance with Institute regulations. \n\n \n11 \nAt least one subject from six of the following eleven areas: \n \nw Mechanics of Solids \nw Design \nw Materials \nw Manufacturing \nw Fluid Mechanics \nw Nanotechnology \nw Thermodynamics/Heat Transfer \nw Energy \nw System Dynamics & Control \nw Bioengineering \nw Dynamics \n \n \n• One subject on management/economics as approved by the Mechanical \nEngineer’s Degree Coordinator. \n \nStudents entering MIT's Graduate School with a Master’s degree are permitted to \ntransfer no more than 24 units of graduate credit from another school to the MIT record. \nNo thesis units may be transferred. Subjects being transferred to MIT records should have \na grade of B or higher. \n \n7.3 Thesis \n \nThe thesis may be an extension of a SMME/SMOE/SMNAME/SMOGE thesis, or it \nmay be a separate piece of work. An important requirement is that the relevance of the \nthesis work to the solution of real, practical engineering problems be considered, including \nboth its technical and socio-economic aspects. Students are required to submit a thesis \nproposal to the Mechanical Engineer’s Degree Coordinator shortly after embarking on the \nprogram. Students who enter the program with an SM degree from another school must do \na separate Engineer’s thesis. \n \nThe thesis work described in the preceding paragraph can be carried out under the \nsubject 2.999 and/or 2.ThG. A student may receive a maximum of 12 units of credit for \nthesis work done under 2.999 (the student’s thesis advisor determining the actual amount \nof credit) and these credit units may be counted towards the 162 total credit unit \nrequirement. Students may only register for 2.999 in the semester they are receiving the \nMechanical Engineer’s degree. Thesis work done under 2.ThG cannot be counted towards \nthe 162 credit unit coursework requirement. \n \n7.4 Oral presentation \n \nCandidates must make an oral presentation of their Mechanical Engineer’s degree \nthesis work during their final semester of residence. These presentations are usually \nscheduled in January and May. The students typically make a ~ twenty-minute presentation \non the technical aspects of the thesis work including its usefulness in engineering \napplications in general. The Mechanical Engineering Degree Coordinator should be \ncontacted in order to schedule this. S/he will invite additional faculty members to attend \nthe presentation. Typically, there will be 3 faculty members at the presentation not including \nthe advisor. Completion of the degree requires a satisfactory presentation. \n \n\n \n12 \n8 Naval Engineer’s Degree \nNaval Engineering is considered to include all the arts and sciences as applied in the \ndesign, construction and operation of surface and sub-surface marine vehicles. The Naval \nEngineer’s degree provides an opportunity for further study beyond the Master’s level and \nis intended for those who wish to enter engineering practice, or who plan a career in the \ndesign, acquisition, repair, and modernization of ships and ship systems. This degree \nemphasizes breadth of knowledge in naval engineering and is quite distinct from the PhD, \nwhich emphasizes depth and originality of research. \n \nThe overall course of study and thesis must comprise a coherent program in naval \nengineering. The candidate is required to prepare a plan of study and to submit it to the \nMechE Graduate Officer for approval by the Naval Engineer's degree Subcommittee. The \nstudent will be considered a Naval Engineer's degree candidate when this plan is approved. \n \n8.1 Writing ability \n \nStudents must successfully fulfill the writing ability requirement described in Section \n4. \n \n8.2 Credit units \n \nThe credit requirements are as follows: \n \n• 162 graduate-level credit units (including credited units taken during the Master’s \nDegree program and no more than 12 units of credit received for thesis work done \nunder 2.999 (see below)). No credit will be awarded for subjects taken on a P/D/F \nbasis. Credit for classes taken under the special grading policy announced for the \nSpring or Fall of 2020 will be awarded in accordance with Institute regulations. \n \n1. At least one subject from eight of the following eleven areas (subjects from various \nMIT departments are normally taken to satisfy this requirement): \n \nw Mathematics & Numerical \nMethods \nw Structural Mechanics \nw Dynamics \nw Acoustics \nw Hydrodynamics \nw Ship Production \nw Materials & Fabrication \nTechnology \nw Naval Architecture & Systems \nEngineering \nw Power and Propulsion \nw Ship Design \nw Probability & Statistics \n \n \n \n2. Ship design is an integral part of the Naval Engineer’s Degree curriculum. \nCandidates are required to complete both a conversion design project (2.704) and a \n24-credit new design project (2.705) during their course of study. \n\n \n13 \n \n8.3 Thesis \n \nStudents must complete a thesis that demonstrates the educational maturity and breadth \nexpected of candidates for this degree. An important requirement is that the thesis deal with \nthe solution of real, practical engineering problems, including both their technical and \nsocio-economic aspects. It must be at least equivalent to an advanced master's thesis, and \nmay be an extension of a suitable applications-oriented SMME/SMOE/SMNAME/ \nSMOGE thesis, or it may be a separate piece of work. Students who enter the program with \nan SM degree from another school must do a separate Naval Engineer’s thesis. Students \nare required to submit a specific thesis proposal to the Naval Engineer’s Degree \nSubcommittee shortly after embarking on the program. \n \nThe thesis work described in the preceding paragraph can be carried out under the \nsubject 2.999 and/or 2.ThG. A student may receive a maximum of 12 units of credit for \nthesis work done under 2.999 (the student’s thesis advisor determining the actual amount \nof credit) and these credit units may be counted towards the 162 total credit unit \nrequirement. Thesis work done under 2.ThG cannot be counted towards the 162 credit unit \ncoursework requirement. \n \n8.4 Qualifying examination \n \nCandidates should take the Naval Engineer’s degree qualifying examination during \ntheir first year of residence. These exams are given by the Naval Engineer’s Degree \nSubcommittee, usually in January and May. The examination is an oral one in which the \nstudents make a twenty-minute presentation of their thesis proposal and work to date, \nplacing approximately equal emphasis on the technical aspects of the work and on its \nusefulness in engineering applications in general. Questions on the thesis and related areas \nwill be asked, and the Subcommittee will render its judgment based on both the technical \ncontent of the work and its utility in engineering practice. \n \nThe qualifying examination for the Naval Engineer’s degree may be waived for \ncandidates with either 3 years military or 5 years industrial post-Bachelor’s Degree \nexperience, and with concurrence from the MechE Graduate Officer. \n \n9 Doctoral Program (PhD/ScD) \nThe highest academic degree is the Doctor of Science, or Doctor of Philosophy. At \nMIT, these degrees differ in name only. The doctorate is awarded upon the completion of \na program of advanced study, principally at the Institute, and the performance of significant \noriginal research, design or development. \n \n9.1 Admission into the doctoral program \n \n1. Students from outside MIT may apply to the doctoral program if they will have \ncompleted a master’s degree in engineering by the time they enroll for the PhD; see \nSections 9.2 and 9.3. \n\n \n14 \n \n2. Students who are in the MechE Department’s SM program, and wish to continue \nfor a PhD, will automatically be enrolled in the doctoral program effective the day \non which they submit their master’s thesis provided they have maintained a \ncumulative GPA of 4.5 or better in graduate-level subjects at MIT. \n \nAll students must take and pass the doctoral qualifying examinations according to the \ntimeline given below. A student is considered to be a (qualified) candidate in the doctoral \nprogram upon passing the qualifying examinations. \n \n9.2 Requirements for a doctoral degree \n \nThe five basic requirements for the doctoral degree are: \n \n(1) \nthe writing ability requirement, which all graduate students must satisfy; \n \n(2) \nthe doctoral qualifying examination; \n \n(3) \na major program of advanced study; \n \n(4) \na minor program of study in a field different from that of the major; and \n \n(5) \na thesis. \n \nDetails of the five basic requirements are given below, followed by the rules \n(procedure, schedules, etc.) that pertain to the doctoral program. \n \nThe program of study comprised of the major, minor, and additional supporting \nsubjects will typically consist of at least 144 graduate-level credit units (12 subjects). \nNo credit will be awarded for subjects taken on a P/D/F basis. Credit for classes taken \nunder the special grading policy announced for the Spring or Fall of 2020 will be awarded \nin accordance with Institute regulations. Up to a maximum of 12 units of subject 2.989 \n(Experiential Learning in Mechanical Engineering) may be counted towards the 144-unit \ncredit requirement. Graduate-level subjects taken toward a Master’s degree may be used to \nsatisfy the requirements of the doctorate. Graduate-level subjects taken at another graduate \nschool may also be counted toward the MIT doctorate, if approved by both the Graduate \nOfficer and the candidate’s thesis committee. The limit is 72 credit units for subjects taken \noutside MIT. \n \n9.2.1 Writing ability requirement \n \nStudents must successfully fulfill the writing ability requirement described in Section \n4. \n \n \n\n \n15 \n9.2.2 Doctoral qualifying examination \n \nThe purpose of the doctoral qualifying examination (QE) is to determine whether the \napplicant possesses the attributes of a successful doctoral candidate at MIT: mastery of the \nmechanical/ocean engineering disciplines coupled with ingenuity and skill in identifying \nand solving unfamiliar problems. The QE serves to ensure that the ME PhD student (1) has \nmaturity (cohesive and holistic view) in the disciplinary foundations of modern ME and \nclosely-related disciplines, (2) has depth in an area and the breadth expected of mechanical \nengineers, (3) can think analytically and synthetically to construct rational and sound \nsolutions to unfamiliar problems at an advanced level in engineering and engineering \nsciences, (4) can communicate effectively (including ability to organize thoughts), and (5) \ncan respond reactively and cogently to questions or points raised in professional \ndiscussions and interactions; it also (6) enables ME faculty to collectively assess the \nstudents. \n \nThe QEs are offered twice yearly (January and May) over a two-day period. Students \nare allowed to take the subject exams (SQE + RQE Part I) in a semester prior to taking the \nresearch skills exam (RQE Part II). A student whose highest degree (at entry to the graduate \nprogram) is a Bachelor’s degree, must take both parts (SQE + RQE I and II) of the QE (for \nthe first time) no later than the end of 5 regular semesters (fall and spring). A student \nentering the graduate program with a Master’s degree must take both parts of the QE (for \nthe first time) no later than the end of 3 regular semesters (fall and spring). In rare and \nextraordinary circumstances, a student may be granted one extra semester by the Graduate \nOfficer. Petitions require a letter of support from the student’s thesis supervisor. Students \nwho wish to discuss sensitive matters should feel free to contact the Graduate Officer \ndirectly or via the Graduate Student Ambassador, Professor Betar Gallant \n(bgallant@mit.edu). \n \nIn order to be eligible to take the QE the student must have maintained a cumulative \nGPA of not less than 4.5 in the MIT graduate program. In addition, the candidate must \nhave obtained 2 A’s and 1 B or better in graduate-level MechE department classes at MIT1. \nStudents who wish to take the exam at the end of their second semester will not have \nsufficient time to meet the above requirement. In that exceptional case, students must have \ndemonstrated at least two A grades in Mechanical Engineering graduate-level subjects in \ntheir first semester, and a cumulative GPA no lower than 4.5, to be eligible to take the \nexam. These grades must be already in the student’s transcript at the time of signing up for \nthe exam (typically, October 1 and March 1 for the January and May exams, respectively) \nand not anticipate results from classes taken in the semester leading to the exam. As a \nresult, the exam cannot be taken by students at the end of their first semester in the graduate \nprogram. Only students admitted to the MechE graduate (SM/PhD) program can take the \nPhD qualifying exam. \n \n \n \n \n                                                   \n1 Special subjects cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. \n\n \n16 \nThe QE consists of three components: \n1. SQE: two subject examinations exploring the student’s breadth of knowledge in                         \nselected MechE disciplines, \n2. RQE (Part I): a subject examination exploring the student’s depth of knowledge in \nthe student’s chosen area of research, and \n3. RQE (Part II): an examination of the student’s research skills.  \n \nThe QE takes place over two days and is organized as follows: \n \nDay 1: Three subject examinations, each consisting of a 30-minute oral exam. Two of \nthese exams will be in two subject areas selected by the candidate and will comprise the \nstudent’s SQE. The third examination will be in the student’s chosen area of research and \nwill comprise Part I of the student’s RQE. \n \nDay 2: Research Qualifying Examination-Part II, consisting of one 45-minute oral \nexamination in the candidate’s field of research that explores the student's research skills. \n \nFor the subject examinations, the student must pick 3 distinct areas from the approved \nlists below, choosing at least 2 from the C (core)-list and not more than 1 from the S \n(specialized)-list. The student must also indicate the one area that the RQE (Part-I and Part- \nII) is to be in. New subject areas may be added to these lists with one semester’s advanced \nnotice; existing subjects may be removed, but only with a minimum of two years’ notice. \n \nDuring Part II of the RQE the student will: \n \n• Make a 25-min presentation of the student's original research (such as work for \na previously completed SM thesis (at MIT or elsewhere) or initial work at MIT \ntowards a doctoral thesis). \n• Respond to questions on that research for 20 minutes. \nThe student's advisor can be present during both parts of the RQE but is not permitted \nto participate in Part II of the exam. They may, however, participate in Part I. \n \nAt least 2 weeks before the RQE, the student must provide the Graduate Office with a \nbrief one-page abstract of the research presentation. This will help the faculty participating \nin the RQE anticipate and prepare for the specific knowledge domain(s) that will arise \nduring each student's exam.  \n \nThe MechE Department faculty as a whole review and discuss each student’s \nperformance in the qualifying examinations, together with their GPA and other holistic \naspects of their performance in the graduate program at MIT, and make decisions regarding \npassing, being allowed to repeat the exams, or failing. Prior to review by the department \nfaculty, scores are assigned by the exam committees for each student for each exam taken, \nwith a score of 7/10 being a pass. Passing the QE requires passing Part II of the RQE, as \nwell as any 2 (or more) of the 3 subject area examinations. Students who satisfy the nominal \nrequirement for a pass in both the SQE + RQE Part I and RQE Part II exams pass the exam. \nThese cases are usually not discussed.  In the case of borderline failing performance, other \n\n \n17 \naspects of student performance in the graduate program, any special circumstances that \nmay have adversely affected student performance in the exam, as well as the best interest \nof the student are typically taken into account in making the decision. Advisors who are \nnot in MechE are also invited to these meetings, but they cannot participate in decision-\nmaking. \n \nA student who does not pass the doctoral qualifying examination may be permitted to \nretake all or part of the exam. They must do so the next time the exams are offered. In no \ncase is a candidate allowed to repeat more than once. \n \nResults will be provided to the student after the outcomes of the exam have been decided \nupon. For students who pass the QE, scores are not shared, but written feedback is provided \non RQE Part II. Students who do not pass the QE can obtain feedback and scores from the \nGraduate Officer or their advisor; they are also encouraged to reach out to their QE \nexaminers for additional feedback. \n \nEffective September 2025, in the semester prior to taking the Qualifying Exams, \nstudents may register for up to 12 units of academic self-study credit that support preparation \nfor the Exams and that count towards fulfilling PhD degree credit requirements. These units \ncannot be used to satisfy requirements towards any other graduate degree (including the \nMechE SM) or the PhD degree minor.  Students interested in this option should register for \nsubject 2.975. \n \nSubject specific information on the qualifying examination can be found in the \ndocument \"Qualifying Exams: Guidelines and Formats\" available on the GAME website. \n \nCore subject areas: C-List \n \nThe subject or subjects most suitable for preparation for these exams are included in \nparentheses. \n \nDynamics (2.032) \nFluids (2.25) or Hydrodynamics (2.20), not both \nHeat Transfer (2.55 or 2.51+2.52J) \nMachine Design (2.72) or Product Design (2.744 or 2.739J), not both \nManufacturing (2.810) \nMicro and Nano Engineering--Theory (2.37) \nSolid Mechanics (2.071) or Structures (2.080J), not both \nStochastic Dynamical Systems (2.122) \nSystem Dynamics & Controls (2.140 and 2.151) \nThermodynamics (2.42) \n \n \n\n \n18 \n \nSpecialized subjects/fields: S-List \n \nAcoustics (2.066)2 \nBiomechanical Engineering (2.788 or 2.795J or 2.798J) \nComputational Engineering (2.097J or 2.29) \nMicro and Nano Engineering--Experiment (2.675), cannot be chosen with Micro and \nNano Engineering--Theory \nOptics (2.710 or 2.717 or 2.719 or 2.c67) \nRobotics3 (2.120); cannot be chosen with both System Dynamics & Controls and \nDynamics \n \nSubjects not chosen for three consecutive years (6 offerings of the exam) will be removed \nfrom this list (subject to two years notice). \n9.2.3 Major program of study \n \nThe major is a program of advanced study, typically consisting of 6 to 7 graduate \nsubjects, which gives the candidate both depth and breadth in their research field, approved \nby the student's thesis committee and the Graduate Officer. Examples of the major areas \nof some current students are: Biomedical Engineering, Computational Engineering, Design \nof Mechanical Products, Dynamical Systems, Interfacial Engineering, Materials, Nano- \nengineering, Ocean Acoustics, Renewable Energy & Water, and Robotics. The choice of \narea should be discussed with the Graduate Officer. \n \nThe set of major subjects should bring candidates to the state of the art in their chosen \nfield, insofar as that is possible via coursework. Candidates must satisfy their Doctoral \nCommittee and the Graduate Officer that their proposed program meets this intent. The \nmajor represents the principal component of the candidate’s coursework. \n \n9.2.4 Minor program of study \n \nThe minor is a program of advanced study that develops competence in an area different \nfrom the candidate’s principal field of interest. Three subjects (not less than 24 units) must \nbe taken in a coherent field different from the major. These subjects may be taken inside \nor outside the Department. \n \nIf the minor is in an area of mechanical engineering or in mathematics, all three subjects \nmust be at the graduate-level. In other fields, some undergraduate subject content may be \nacceptable, depending on the remoteness of the field from mechanical engineering and on \nthe prerequisites required for graduate subjects. \n \n                                                   \n2 For candidates in the Joint MIT/WHOI program, Acoustics is considered a Core subject. \n3 For candidates in the Joint MIT/WHOI program, Robotics is considered a Core subject. \n \n\n \n19 \nStudents who have a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in a field distinctly different from \nmechanical engineering may receive complete or partial credit toward the minor. With this \nexception, all minor subjects must be taken while registered in graduate school. \n \nThe minor program must be approved in advance by the student’s thesis committee \nand by the Graduate Officer, who places on file a record of the anticipated program as soon \nas it is formulated. Any subsequent modifications must have the Graduate Officer’s \napproval. A minimum grade point average of 3.5 must be attained for the subjects that \ncomprise the minor. \n \n9.2.5 Doctoral Thesis \n \nThe thesis is a major, original work that makes a significant contribution in its field. It \nis the principal component of the doctoral program, and the part that serves as the major \nindicator of a candidate’s abilities. \n \nThe thesis is supervised by a faculty advisor and monitored by a doctoral thesis \ncommittee, which must include at least three MIT faculty members (including their \nadvisor) with no conflicts of interest (e.g. members of the same family), and at least two of \nthe three MIT faculty members must be MechE faculty.4 The doctoral committee is usually \nchaired by the thesis advisor, unless the advisor is not a member of the MechE faculty, in \nwhich case a MechE faculty member must chair the committee. At least one of the \ncommittee members must be from outside the extended research group with which the \ncandidate is associated. The candidate may also invite qualified people from outside the \nMIT faculty to serve as additional members of the committee. WHOI students must have \nat least one committee member from MechE and one from the WHOI AOPE department; \nthe committee chair can be either from MechE or AOPE. \n \nWork already accomplished elsewhere, not under the supervision of a member of the \nMIT faculty, cannot be accepted in full or partial fulfillment of the thesis requirement. \n \n9.3 Rules and procedures of the doctoral program (post-qualifying examination) \n \nA student is considered to be a (qualified) candidate in the doctoral program upon \npassing the qualifying examinations. The candidate is responsible for initiating the various \nparts of the program and for keeping his/her Online Doctoral Program Record \n(informally called the “online History Card”) up to date; this may be found on the MechE \nDepartment website by navigating to Online Grad Card from the bottom of any page of the \nMechE website http://meche.mit.edu. The doctoral program milestones are as follows: \n \n1. The candidate selects a field of principal interest, finds a faculty member who is \nwilling to act as thesis advisor, and defines, at least tentatively, an area of research for the \nthesis. If the advisor is not in the MechE Department, the student must also find a faculty \nmember from within the Department who will act as doctoral committee chair. \n                                                   \n4 Includes Senior or Principal Research Scientists and Engineers who hold an appointment in the \nMechanical Engineering Department and may supervise PhD students. Limited to one SRS/PRS per \ncommittee. \n\n \n20 \n \n2. The candidate must meet with the Graduate Officer, in person, within one year \nof passing the qualifying examination. Topics to be discussed will include the tentative \nchoice of thesis committee members along with the major and minor programs of study. \n \n3. As soon as possible after that, and under no circumstances later than the end of \nthe first year after passing the qualifying examinations, the student must form the thesis \ncommittee, having obtained prior approval of the membership from the thesis advisor and \nthe Graduate Officer. The names of the committee members should be entered on the online \nHistory Card. If a doctoral thesis committee has not been formed by the end of the first full \nyear after passing the qualifying examination, a grade of U (Unsatisfactory) will be \nawarded for subject 2.THG at the end of the first semester in which it becomes overdue \n(and all subsequent semesters for which it is overdue). \n \nThe committee is formed according to Section 9.2.5, Doctoral Thesis (above). In \nrecruiting the most appropriate members for the thesis committee, it is often helpful (but \nnot required) for the candidate to have a written document (a rough “pre-proposal”) \ndescribing preliminary ideas for the thesis research. The doctoral committee, together with \nthe thesis advisor, will be the student’s primary source of advice and guidance. They will \nmonitor and guide the research and act as mentors in the selection of the major, minor, and \nadditional subjects as the student’s education evolves. Given that external circumstances \n(such as source of funding and expectations therefrom) may change, the thesis committee \nmembership may be changed if necessary. \n \n4. At the same time, and under no circumstances later than the end of the first \nyear after passing the qualifying examinations, the student must have a doctoral thesis \nproposal in place. If a doctoral thesis proposal has not been submitted to the Graduate \nOffice by the end of the first full year after passing the qualifying examination, a grade of \nU (Unsatisfactory) will be awarded for subject 2.THG at the end of the first semester in \nwhich it becomes overdue (and all subsequent semesters for which it is overdue). \n \nThis is a proposal, not a summary of the doctoral thesis. It represents a plan for work, \nrather than a binding contract; the actual work will be guided and reviewed by the thesis \nsupervisor and the thesis committee, and may evolve in unexpected directions. The purpose \nof the proposal is to let the faculty know what the candidate intends to do, and how s/he \nintends to go about it. This requires the students to think critically about their work in \nconsultation with their advisor, helping them define the project and identify possible \npitfalls and problems. It also serves to cultivate the ability to identify research problem(s) \nin the context of prior knowledge and art, design research in an appropriate context, and to \nexpress it clearly and comprehensively in a written document. The proposal should provide \nsufficient literature citations to indicate awareness of the broad field and previous work, \nand enough detail to show how the work is expected to advance the state-of-the-art. It is \ntypically limited to six pages of text and figures (not including the cover page). \n \nThe one-page cover should (only) include: tentative title of the thesis, student's name, \nbrief abstract, keywords, and a list of the committee members indicating the Chair and/or \nAdvisor, their official titles, departmental affiliations and email addresses. \n \n\n \n21 \nThe candidate must provide the Graduate Office with an electronic of the complete \nthesis proposal, and a separate electronic copy of the cover page only. Once these have \nbeen submitted, it should be so recorded on the online History Card. \n \nThe Graduate Office will distribute copies of the cover page with the abstract to all \nMechE faculty. The full thesis proposal will be made available to any MechE Department \nfaculty member who requests it. Feedback from the faculty should be welcomed and taken \nconstructively. \n \n5. As soon as possible after forming the thesis committee — and under no \ncircumstances later than the end of the three regular semesters after passing the qualifying \nexaminations — the student must have in place a proposed program of study for the major \nand minor. \n \nThe candidate must get approval of their major and minor list of subjects from the \ndoctoral committee at its first meeting. It must also be submitted for review and approval \nto the Graduate Officer. The programs of study for the major and minor should be entered \non the online History Card. Subjects may be added to, or taken out of, these programs with \nthe approval of the thesis committee and Graduate Officer. \n \n6. The candidate shall arrange regular meetings with the doctoral committee and \nobtain the committee’s comments on his/her work. It is recommended that the thesis \ncommittee meet at least once each regular semester (fall and spring); the Department \nrequires that the committee meet at least once each year. The chair of the committee should \nmake a notation of each meeting on the online History Card together with a brief summary \nof the student’s progress. A student whose progress is unsatisfactory may be required by \nthe Department, upon a suitable recommendation (typically a U-grade for thesis research) \nfrom the student’s Thesis Advisor/Thesis Committee, and/or MechE Graduate Officer, to \nwithdraw from the doctoral program. \n \n7. When the thesis is completed, upon recommendation of the doctoral committee, \nit shall be presented orally in an open meeting of MIT faculty, staff, and students. After \nthe presentation, the thesis is either accepted or rejected by the thesis committee and any \nother departmental faculty members present. The faculty signatures and result should \nbe entered on the online History Card. \n \nThe thesis presentation is to be scheduled by the doctoral candidate. The student is \nresponsible for obtaining a time and place for the presentation, and for arranging through \nthe Graduate Office to send an announcement of the presentation to the departmental \nfaculty. The thesis defense must be scheduled and announced at least two weeks in \nadvance. Electronic copies of the thesis must be sent to the Graduate Office and each \nmember of the doctoral committee at least two weeks prior to the presentation. The copy \nin the Graduate Office will be available for the faculty at large. \n \nA student whose thesis defense is scheduled during the summer must provide the \nGraduate Office with a list of at least 6 MIT faculty members (including Principal/Senior \nResearch Scientists/Engineers) who have expressed the intent of being present at the \n\n \n22 \ndefense. The 6 faculty members may include the MIT members of the student's thesis \ncommittee all of whom are expected to be present. \n \nFollowing successful defense, the candidate must submit a final electronic copy of the \nthesis to the Graduate Office, by the end-of-term doctoral thesis due date established by \nMIT (consult with the Graduate Office). If this deadline is not met, the thesis cannot be \naccepted in the current term. \n \nThe key dates and timeline described above are summarized on the next page. \n \n \n\n \n23 \n \nKey dates and timeline \n \nWhen each of the milestones listed here has been achieved, this information should be \nrecorded in the student’s online History Card. \n \n \n• \nDuring 1st \nterm after \nqualifying \nØ Identify thesis advisor (and if needed the Thesis Committee \nChair). \nØ Identify general area of thesis research. \n• \nWithin 1 \nyear of \nqualifying \nØ Meet with Graduate Officer to discuss tentative plans for \nmembership of the Thesis Committee, major & minor \ncurricula. \n• \nWithin 1 \nyear of \nqualifying \nØ Form Thesis Committee after getting prior approval of the \nmembership from thesis advisor and the Graduate Officer. \nØ Write thesis proposal (up-to 6 pages). After obtaining \ncommittee approval, submit the proposal and an abstract to \nthe Graduate Office. The Graduate Office will circulate it to \nthe Department faculty. \n• \nWithin 3 \nregular \nsemesters of \nqualifying \nØ Obtain Thesis Committee’s and Graduate Officer’s approval \nof major & minor curricula. \n• \nOnce each \nregular \nsemester (fall \n& spring) \nØ Meet with Thesis Committee. \nØ After each meeting Thesis Committee Chair to record \nprogress on online History Card. \n• \nAt least 2 \nweeks prior \nto Defense \nDate \nØ Student to schedule defense and inform Graduate Office so \nthey can announce it. \n• \nAt least 2 \nweeks prior \nto Defense \nDate \nØ Send copy of thesis (draft) electronically to Thesis Committee \nand Graduate Office. \n• \nImmediately \nafter Defense \nØ Thesis Committee and other department faculty members \n(present at defense) to fill out online History Card and record \nthe result. \n \n \nA list of the key dates on the MIT academic calendar can be found here. It includes \ndegree application deadlines, and the dates by which theses must be submitted. \n\n \n24 \n9.4 Interdisciplinary doctoral programs \n \nGraduate students registered in the Department of Mechanical Engineering may elect \nto participate in several interdisciplinary doctoral programs of study including those listed \nbelow. Students must fulfill all of the MechE Department requirements as described above, \nand in addition satisfy the specific requirements of the particular interdisciplinary program. \nThe interdisciplinary programs currently available include the following. \n \n9.4.1 Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) \n \nThe Computational Science and Engineering doctoral program enables students who \nwork on computational thesis research to graduate with a doctoral degree in “Mechanical \nEngineering and Computation” (instead of the traditional “Mechanical Engineering” thesis \nfield designation). Computational thesis research includes the development of new \ncomputational methods and/or the innovative application of computational techniques to \nimportant problems in engineering and science. This program is administered jointly by \nthe MechE Department and the Center for Computational Science and Engineering. The \ndegree track requires the completion of a Major field of study consisting of at least 5 \ngraduate-level subjects in computational science and engineering; additional requirements, \nas well as more information can be found at http://cse.mit.edu/programs/phd/. \n \n9.4.2 Interdisciplinary PhD in Statistics (IDPS) \n \nThe Interdisciplinary PhD in Statistics (IDPS) enables qualifying students to graduate \nwith a doctoral degree in “Mechanical Engineering and Statistics”. This program is \nadministered jointly by the MechE Department and the MIT Institute for Data, Systems \nand Society (IDSS). Enrolled students must complete coursework that satisfies the \nrequirements of the MechE doctoral program as well as the IDPS requirements as outlined \nat https://stat.mit.edu/academics/idps/idps-meche/. They also need to produce a thesis that \ninvolves Statistics in a substantial manner. The student’s doctoral thesis committee, \nincluding the approval process for the thesis proposal, must include at least one faculty \nmember from the Statistics and Data Science Center. For more information, please contact \nProfessor Sapsis. \n \n9.4.3 Joint Program with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution \n \nThe Joint Program with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) is intended \nfor students whose primary career objective is oceanography or oceanographic \nengineering. Students divide their academic and research efforts between the campuses of \nMIT and WHOI and receive a degree in Oceanographic Engineering. The program is \ndescribed in detail at http://mit.whoi.edu/. \n \n9.4.4 The Program in Polymers and Soft Matter (PPSM) \n \nThe Program in Polymers and Soft Matter (PPSM) is an interdisciplinary program that \noffers Ph.D. students from five different departments, including Mechanical Engineering, \n\n \n25 \na core curriculum in the science and engineering of polymers and other soft matter systems. \nFaculty members affiliated with PPSM cover a wide range of research topics, including \nadditive manufacturing, biomedical devices, computational modeling, and advanced \nsynthesis. PPSM has its own set of qualifying exams and a doctoral candidacy process that \ntakes the place of MechE's qualifying exams. Every semester, PPSM offers a seminar series \nfeaturing leading polymer science researchers from around the world, with participation \nexpected from all PPSM students. \n \n \nPPSM requires its students to complete a major program consisting of at least 4 core \nclasses in polymer science and engineering, as well as 2 additional polymer-related elective \ncourses that must be approved by the program head. PPSM students with MechE as their \nhome department must also complete a minor in Mechanical Engineering, consisting of at \nleast 3 MechE classes from at least two of the seven MechE Thrust Areas, with a grade of \nB or higher. Students enrolled in PPSM are expected to follow the same requirements and \ntimelines as those in the MechE doctoral program, including taking a total of at least \n144 graduate-level, letter-graded credit units. Graduate units from the Seminar in Polymers \nand Soft Matter (3.903/10.960) can be used to satisfy the 144-unit requirement. They are \nalso expected to follow the post-qualifying exam processes described in section 9.3 of \nthis guide, including having their major and minor program of studies approved by the \nMechE Graduate Officer. Upon completing their qualifying exams (either MechE or \nPPSM), PPSM students need to inform the MechE Graduate Office, which will proceed to \ncreate a History Card to be completed by the student and approved by the Graduate Officer \nfollowing their meeting. \n \nFor more information on the PPSM program, please visit the PPSM \nwebsite http://polymerscience.mit.edu/ \n \n10 Financial Support and Thesis Supervision \n10.1 Types of financial aid available \n \nThe Mechanical Engineering Department offers three types of financial assistance to \ngraduate students: fellowships, research assistantships, and teaching assistantships. \n \nA fellowship provides students with a direct grant, and leaves them open to select their \nown research project and supervisor. A number of students in the Department are supported \nby fellowships from outside agencies, and a few are available from MIT. However, the \nDepartment itself has relatively few fellowships to offer. \n \nThe majority of students in the MechE Department are supported by research \nassistantships, which are appointments to work on particular research projects with \nparticular faculty members. The faculty members procure research grants for various \nprojects, and hire graduate students to carry out the research. The research is almost \ninvariably structured so that it becomes the student’s thesis. A fulltime RA appointment \nprovides a full tuition scholarship (i.e. covers all tuition) plus a salary that is adequate for \na single person. In return for a fully funded education, RAs are required to do a certain \n\n \n26 \namount of work for the grant that funds them. In most cases, this work becomes the \nstudent’s thesis project. Consistent with this requirement, an RA may register for no more \nthan 24 units of classroom work (typically two subjects) per regular term, and must do at \nleast the equivalent of 24 units of thesis work (i.e. research on the project) per term. The \nsummer term is usually spent on thesis work. \n \nTeaching assistants are appointed to work on specific subjects of instruction. As the \nname implies, TAs usually assist a faculty member in teaching, often grading homework \nproblems and tutoring students. In the Mechanical Engineering Department, TAs are \nseldom used for regular full-time classroom teaching, but typically provide support to \nfaculty instructors, conduct review sessions, hold office hours, or lead lab sections, etc. \ndepending on the subject. TAs are limited to 48 units of credit per regular term with a \nmaximum of 24 units of classroom work and cannot register for the subject that they are \nteaching. A TA appointment usually does not extend through the summer. The Associate \nDepartment Head for Education (currently John Leonard) oversees the TA allocation \nprocess. Information regarding TAs is communicated via email to Mechanical Engineering \ngraduate students, typically toward the end of the fall semester for spring TAs, and in early \nsummer for fall TAs. \nExperience has shown that the optimum graduate program consists of about equal \nmeasures of coursework and research, consistent with an RA appointment. One advantage \nof a fellowship is greater freedom in choosing a research project and supervisor. Another \nis that, unlike an RA, a fellowship student is not limited to two courses per term, and may \ntherefore be able to finish a degree in a somewhat shorter time. \n \nA teaching assistantship gives the student teaching experience and can also be \nextremely valuable for reviewing basic subject material: for example, in preparation for the \ndoctoral general exams. It does not, however, leave much time for thesis research, and may \nextend the time that the student will need to complete a degree. \n \n10.2 How to get a research assistantship or teaching assistantship \n \nOnce a student is formally admitted to the Department, s/he is eligible for an \nassistantship. At this point it helps to understand how the funding of graduate research \nworks in MIT’s Engineering School. The faculty write proposals for specific research, and \nwhen they receive funding, they hire graduate Research Assistants to do the research \nwith/for them. The MechE Graduate Office distributes a list of admitted students to all \nMechE faculty members, noting each student’s interests, previous university affiliation, \ngrade point average, etc. Many faculty select candidates from this list for the positions they \nhave available. (See also the paragraph after next.) They make their final selections after \nreviewing the students’ application files. At that point, they contact a student, with a \nspecific offer for a research assistantship. A particular student may get offers from several \nprofessors, in which case he/she has to make a choice about which one to accept. \n \nThe graduate research enterprise is thus somewhat like a free enterprise system, with \nthe individual professors looking for the best students for their research projects and the \nstudents looking for the most interesting or satisfying research experience. \n \n\n \n27 \nWhat can students who have just been accepted do to improve the chances in this \nprocess? The first step is to carefully read the research areas as listed on the MechE website \nhttp://meche.mit.edu. From these areas students can identify the faculty members they \nwould like to work with, and should not hesitate to write, e-mail, or telephone them; they \nshould not be shy about making the professors aware of any special qualifications that they \n(the students) might possess (previous research experience, etc.). \n \nStudents seeking research assistantships should be aware that many, if not most, \ncommitments are made after April 15. Positions become available through the spring and \nsummer, depending on when the research grants come in, and a significant fraction of new \nresearch assistantship offers are made after the beginning of the fall term. Most graduate \nstudents end up with funding by the end of their first term. \n \nTeaching Assistantships are relatively few in number, and are usually offered to \nstudents who are already at MIT and known to the departmental faculty. A student who \nhas a keen interest in serving as a TA in a particular subject can make it known by \ncontacting the faculty member in charge (listed in the MIT Bulletin under the description \nof each subject).  \n \n10.3 How to find a thesis supervisor if you have independent funding \n \nStudents who have fellowships or are privately funded need to associate themselves \nwith a faculty member who will supervise their thesis research. They should choose a \nsupervisor in much the same way as another student would try to secure an RA, identifying \nprospective faculty members and checking whether there are projects they can work on. \nResearch requires money, and even though these students require no salary from the \nDepartment, they are well advised to find a supervisor who has some funding for the \nintended work. Although their obligations to the research are not the same as those of an \nRA, in practice they end up working just as hard in order to finish their theses in a \nreasonable time. It is usually a good idea to associate with a supervisor as soon as possible \nafter arrival at MIT. The student then becomes part of a research group, gets a desk to \nwork at, and is in a position to get advice and learn from his/her supervisor and from the \nmore experienced students in the research group. \n \n10.4 Students with advisors outside the MechE Department \n \nA student whose research advisor is not a member of the Mechanical Engineering \nDepartment, must also choose an academic advisor from within the MechE Department. \n(See also Section 10.5.) This should be arranged in consultation with the research advisor \nand should be in place before the start of the student's second semester at MIT. The \nacademic advisor could, for example, be the thesis reader for a Masters student and the \nthesis committee chair for a PhD student. S/he can provide guidance on taking classes, \npreparing for the doctoral qualifying examination, changes in Department policies, etc. \n \n\n \n28 \n10.5 Students conducting their research at a site off-campus \n \nIf a significant part of the student’s research is done off campus (e.g. at a hospital, \nDraper Lab, Lincoln Labs, etc.,), then both of the following conditions must be fulfilled: \n \n(a) The student must have a MechE faculty co-advisor from day-1 with whom the student \nmeets, at least once a term, to describe to him/her the research progress. A MechE faculty \nco-advisor is required even when a student (doing off-site research) has a MIT faculty co- \nadvisor who is not a MechE faculty member. This involvement need not lead to the \nMechE faculty co-advisor being a co-author on any publication. \n \n(b) The off-campus supervisor must submit to the MechE faculty co-advisor and the \nGraduate Office, a short description of the project and expectations of the student. The \nMechE faculty co-advisor needs to be comfortable with that plan before the student starts \nany off-campus research. Each year thereafter, the off-campus supervisor must submit a \nreport to the on-campus advisor describing the progress to-date and the path ahead. \n \nAdditional MIT requirements are described at the website of the Office of the Dean for \nGraduate Education (ODGE): https://odge.mit.edu/gpp/degrees/ \n \n10.6 Rules for students who do nonresidential doctoral thesis work off-campus \n \nAll such students are required to have a MechE faculty member as either thesis \nsupervisor or co-supervisor, and must have completed all requirements other than the \nthesis. (This includes having passed the doctoral qualifying examination, having submitted \na thesis-committee-approved thesis proposal, and having the student's major and minor \nprograms of study approved by the student's doctoral committee and the Graduate Officer.) \nPrior to embarking on work away from campus, a student must submit to the Graduate \nOfficer a plan for finishing the degree, including thesis topic, timetable of academic courses \nat MIT, timetable of planned non-residential periods, and names and coordinates of off- \ncampus supervisors. Both the thesis advisor and the Graduate Officer must approve the \nplan by signature. Students with off-campus co-supervisors (SM as well as PhD \ncandidates) must arrange joint meetings with both their on- and off-campus supervisors at \nleast once every regular term during this period of non-residency. \n \nAdditional MIT requirements are described at the website of the Office for Graduate \nEducation (OGE): https://odge.mit.edu/gpp/degrees/thesis/nonres/ \n \n10.7 Guaranteed Transitional Support \n \nThe Department offers guaranteed financial support to students who need to transition to \na different advisor/group due to an unhealthy advising relationship. Students who wish to \ninquire about this program should get in contact with the Graduate Officer who is \ncurrently serving as the departmental Transitional Support Coordinator (TSC). More \ninformation about the program can be found at https://oge.mit.edu/finances/financial- \nassist/guaranteed-transitional-support/. \n \n",

Students who do not have a confirmed research advisor by Registration Day, and students whose research advisors are based outside the MIT campus (e.g. a hospital or Draper Labs), are required to take this seminar class. The Mechanical Engineering (MechE) Department offers the following graduate degrees: 1. Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (SMME) 2. Master of Science in Ocean Engineering (SMOE) 3. Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering (SMNAME) 4. Master of Science in Oceanographic Engineering (SMOGE, joint MIT/WHOI degree) 5. Master of Engineering in Manufacturing (MEng) 6. Mechanical Engineer's degree 7. Naval Engineer's degree 8. Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) or Doctor of Science (ScD), which differ in name only (this includes the joint MIT/WHOI doctoral degrees) A Master of Science degree is the first graduate degree offered in MechE. It is awarded for the completion of a program of advanced study, together with a thesis that is considered to be the centerpiece of a student’s graduate experience. The Master of Engineering in Manufacturing is a one-year professional degree program that prepares the student to assume a role of technical leadership in the manufacturing industries. The Mechanical Engineer’s degree offers preparation for a career in advanced engineering practice. It does so through a program of advanced coursework that goes well beyond the Master’s level. This degree is not a stepping-stone toward the PhD. The Doctor of Philosophy (or Science) is the highest academic degree offered. It is 4 awarded for the completion of a program of advanced study and a significant original thesis. In what follows, we describe how students can gain entry to the MechE graduate programs (sections 2 and 3) and what they must accomplish to obtain the various degrees (sections 4–9). Section 10 describes some of the means available at MIT to provide financial support to graduate students. It also describes the rules for off-campus research.

Most incoming students will have a degree in mechanical engineering or ocean engineering. However, the Department’s admission criteria are not specific in this regard, and talented students with backgrounds in other branches of engineering or in science may gain entry. To qualify for a graduate degree, applicants are expected to have at least an undergraduate-level exposure to most of the core MechE disciplines (solid mechanics, dynamics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, materials, control, design and manufacturing), and to be familiar with basic electric circuits and electromagnetic field theory. Those who are deemed deficient may be asked to make up courses in certain areas before they graduate. The make-up courses may be at the undergraduate-level (in which case they are relatively elementary and usually cannot be applied toward graduate credit), or at the graduate-level (in which case they carry graduate credit). 3 Admission The method to apply to the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Program is via our online system. See http://meche.mit.edu/academic/graduate/applying/ for more information. All official transcripts must be submitted directly to the MechE Graduate Office, Room 1-112, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139 but only after the student has been admitted. All electronic transcripts should be submitted to megradoffice@mit.edu. The processing of applications for graduate study is done entirely by the Department. The MechE Graduate Admissions Officer, together with a faculty committee, reviews all applications, rank-orders them, and admits the number of applicants that the Department expects it can accommodate. Foreign nationals applying from abroad may be admitted, but must meet all visa requirements (see OGE’s",

The MechE Graduate Admissions Officer, together with a faculty committee, reviews all applications, rank-orders them, and admits the number of applicants that the Department expects it can accommodate. Foreign nationals applying from abroad may be admitted, but must meet all visa requirements (see OGE’s website for details) including securing full financial support for at 5 least the first year in order to register at MIT. This typically comes in the form of a research or teaching assistantship from an individual MIT professor (Section 10 describes how to seek such support), though for some foreign students this support comes from their family, their government, or an international fellowship. Applicants to the graduate program are required to take the general GRE test (Institute Code 3514). Applicants from non-English-speaking countries are also required to take the IELTS, (preferred), or the TOEFL exam; the Duolingo English Test (DET) will also be accepted for the upcoming admissions cycle (Fall 2026 matriculation). Candidates whose citizenship is from India are exempt from taking the IELTS, TOEFL, or DET exam. The minimum acceptable score for the IELTS exam is 7.0, for the TOEFL exam it is 100 (ibt), and for the DET it is 135. Note, we accept the Academic IELTS only (not General Training). Applications are due by December 15 of the previous year and decisions are released on or around February 15. 4 Writing Ability Requirement All incoming graduate students must demonstrate satisfactory English writing ability, or successfully complete appropriate training in writing. This requirement reflects the faculty’s conviction that writing is an essential skill for an engineer with an advanced degree. This also applies to dual degree candidates. The MechE Department requires all incoming graduate students, native as well as foreign, to take the Institute’s Graduate Writing Examination. This exam is administered in the summer before matriculation (http://cmsw.mit.edu/graduate-writing-exam/). Depending on the results, a student will either (a) pass the writing ability requirement, (b) be required to take a relatively short, but intensive, seminar-workshop in expository writing (21W.794 Technical Writing Workshop) during the Independent Activities Period in January, or (c)",

Several courses suitable for engineers and scientists are offered at MIT, and special courses are available for those for whom English is a second language. In addition, MIT requires that all graduate students for whom English has not been the language of instruction in both elementary and secondary school take an English Evaluation Test. This test is separate from the aforementioned Graduate Writing Examination required by the Department. See https://mitgsl.mit.edu/academics- courses/english-evaluation-test-eet for more details. 5 Master of Science (SM) Degrees The requirements for the Master of Science degrees offered by the Department pertain to (1) writing ability, (2) credit units, (3) thesis, and (4) a distribution requirement in the case of the three Ocean-related Master’s degrees. The SMME degree does not have a distribution requirement. The specific requirements are as follows: 6 5.1 Writing ability Students must successfully fulfill the writing ability requirement described in Section 4. 5.2 Credit units • Students must successfully complete at least 72 graduate-level credit units of coursework, not including credit received for (a) 2.S981 (if taken) and (b) thesis work. Following approval by the Graduate Officer and the Institute, certain advanced undergraduate subjects that go beyond the MIT MechE Department's undergraduate degree requirements may be used to satisfy up to 24 units of graduate credit. The Institute requires such subjects to be upgraded to graduate level by completing additional work that needs to be certified by an instructor of a graduate subject as sufficient for obtaining credit towards that subject. Approval should be sought prior to taking such subjects. • The program is expected to include at least three 12-unit graduate-level MechE Department subjects. Upon approval by the Graduate Officer, up to one special subject can be used to satisfy this requirement. Approval should be sought",

Credit for classes taken under the special grading policy announced for the Spring and Fall of 2020 will be awarded in accordance with Institute regulations. Up to a maximum of 12 units of subject 2.989 (Experiential Learning in Mechanical Engineering) may be counted towards the 72-unit credit requirement. • Students are allowed to transfer credit toward their Master’s degree from graduate subjects taken previously at MIT or another accredited institution, and not used as part of the credits required for an undergraduate or graduate degree. The limit is 24 credit units if the subjects were taken outside MIT. Transferred subjects must have a grade of B or higher. No thesis units may be transferred. 5.3 Thesis In the MechE Department, the thesis is considered to be the centerpiece of a student’s graduate experience. The student must complete an acceptable SM thesis under the supervision of an MIT faculty member or a Senior/Principal Research Scientist/Engineer who holds an appointment in the MechE Department. The thesis is an original work of research, design, or development. The supervisor signs and accepts the thesis upon completion. 7 If the supervisor is not a member of the MechE Department, a reader who belongs to the MechE Department faculty must also endorse the thesis.

A graduate subject in each of the following areas is required: (i) Marine Hydrodynamics (2.20); (ii) a subject that emphasizes professional practice in ocean environment, such as Design Principles for Ocean Vehicles (2.22); and (iii) a subject in Acoustics and Sensing (e.g., 2.066), or Structural Mechanics (e.g., 2.080J), or Structural Dynamics (e.g., 2.060J). • Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering (SMNAME). A graduate subject in each of the following areas is required: (i) Marine Hydrodynamics (2.20 or a more advanced subject) and (ii) at least 24 units in their area of concentration. (Background requirements in Introduction to Naval Architecture (e.g., 2.701) and Ship Power and Propulsion (e.g., 2.611) can be waived if previously taken as an undergraduate; otherwise, these subjects need to be taken at MIT.) • Master of Science in Oceanographic Engineering (SMOGE): The MIT/WHOI Joint Program Handbook for Oceanographic Engineering lists the requirements for this degree. (Please see http://mit.whoi.edu/handbooks for the current handbook.) * * * A typical Master’s degree consists of six twelve-unit subjects plus a thesis, and is expected to take a full-time student approximately 2 years (4 regular semesters and the intervening summer and IAP periods) to complete.

Students with a research assistantship will not be able to finish in less than 1.5 years because of the limitation on the number of subjects they are allowed to take per term (see Section 10). At the same time, there is no reason, other than the uncertainties or requirements of research, why they should take longer. The Master’s thesis is essentially a research (or development, or design) apprenticeship under a faculty supervisor, and as such is usually the major contributor to the student’s professional maturation. Incoming students are urged to find a thesis project and supervisor without undue delay. There are several reasons for avoiding delay. The SM thesis is a substantial piece of work and takes time to mature. A student who begins thesis work 8 associates him/herself not only with a faculty member, but usually also with a research group or laboratory where s/he meets other faculty and experienced graduate students from whom to learn and get good advice. It is usually a mistake to think that the degree can be attained more efficiently by taking the coursework first, and putting off the thesis work to the last term. A student’s thesis supervisor usually also serves as the academic advisor. If the thesis supervisor is not a MechE Department faculty member, the student should seek academic advice from an MechE faculty member whose research interests are close to his/her own (such as the departmental thesis reader), or from the Graduate Officer. 5.5 Double SM Degrees Students registered in another engineering department at MIT who wish to earn a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering, Ocean Engineering, Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, or Oceanographic Engineering simultaneously with a Master’s degree with specification in their own department may do so by satisfying both departments’ requirements, with the credit unit requirements satisfied separately, but with a common thesis. Such programs of study must be approved in advance by the Graduate Officers of both the departments involved.

All incoming graduate students must demonstrate satisfactory English writing ability, or successfully complete appropriate training in writing. This requirement reflects the faculty’s conviction that writing is an essential skill for an engineer with an advanced degree. This also applies to dual degree candidates. A student who had previously applied for, but was denied, admission to the MIT MechE Department is not eligible to get a dual degree from the MechE Department. The Department’s procedural requirements are the following: (i) A petition for the dual master’s degree in the MechE Department must be filled out, and adhered to. The student must be admissible to the MechE Department. (ii) The student must select a MechE faculty member as a thesis reader. That faculty member must accept this responsibility by signing the petition. (iii) Items (i) and (ii) must be completed well in advance of thesis completion, but no later than June 1 of the year before the student expects to graduate. Completion of a double SM degree in Mechanical Engineering does not imply admission to the MechE department. Students who want to pursue any other degree in the Department must follow the normal application route for that particular program. The preceding also applies to students registered in Mechanical Engineering who wish to earn an SMME degree simultaneously with one of the Ocean-Engineering Master’s degrees offered by the Department. In this case item (ii) above is modified as follows: the MechE faculty member who serves as the thesis advisor must accept this responsibility by a letter to the MechE Graduate Officer, and ensure that all requirements for the dual degree are met. 6 Master of Engineering (MEng) in Manufacturing The Master of Engineering in Manufacturing is a one-year professional degree program that is intended to prepare the student to assume a role of technical leadership in the 9 manufacturing industries.

Most MIT theses, including MEng theses, are written by a single author. However, some industry projects lend themselves better to joint collaborative research. Permission to undertake a joint thesis must be obtained well in advance of the September degree application deadline from the MEng Program office and then from the Vice-Chancellor or his/her designee. The request for approval for a joint thesis should be submitted to the Office of Graduate Education via the general petition process. To be accepted upon completion, the title page of the joint thesis should bear the signatures of all authors and thesis supervisors. Admission to the MEng program does not imply admission to the MechE SM/PhD program. The latter requires a complete application during the regular admissions process. 7 Mechanical Engineer’s Degree The Mechanical Engineer’s degree provides an opportunity for further study beyond the Master’s level. This degree emphasizes breadth of knowledge in mechanical engineering and its economic and social implications; it is not a stepping-stone toward the PhD. There is no direct admission process to the Mechanical Engineer’s degree; students admitted to the MechE SM and PhD programs are eligible to pursue this degree. The overall course of study and thesis must comprise a coherent program in Mechanical Engineering.

A student may receive a maximum of 12 units of credit for thesis work done under 2.999 (the student’s thesis advisor determining the actual amount of credit) and these credit units may be counted towards the 162 total credit unit requirement. Students may only register for 2.999 in the semester they are receiving the Mechanical Engineer’s degree. Thesis work done under 2.ThG cannot be counted towards the 162 credit unit coursework requirement. 7.4 Oral presentation Candidates must make an oral presentation of their Mechanical Engineer’s degree thesis work during their final semester of residence. These presentations are usually scheduled in January and May. The students typically make a ~ twenty-minute presentation on the technical aspects of the thesis work including its usefulness in engineering applications in general. The Mechanical Engineering Degree Coordinator should be contacted in order to schedule this. S/he will invite additional faculty members to attend the presentation. Typically, there will be 3 faculty members at the presentation not including the advisor. Completion of the degree requires a satisfactory presentation. 12 8 Naval Engineer’s Degree Naval Engineering is considered to include all the arts and sciences as applied in the design, construction and operation of surface and sub-surface marine vehicles. The Naval Engineer’s degree provides an opportunity for further study beyond the Master’s level and is intended for those who wish to enter engineering practice, or who plan a career in the design, acquisition, repair, and modernization of ships and ship systems.

At MIT, these degrees differ in name only. The doctorate is awarded upon the completion of a program of advanced study, principally at the Institute, and the performance of significant original research, design or development. 9.1 Admission into the doctoral program 1. Students from outside MIT may apply to the doctoral program if they will have completed a master’s degree in engineering by the time they enroll for the PhD; see Sections 9.2 and 9.3. 14 2. Students who are in the MechE Department’s SM program, and wish to continue for a PhD, will automatically be enrolled in the doctoral program effective the day on which they submit their master’s thesis provided they have maintained a cumulative GPA of 4.5 or better in graduate-level subjects at MIT. All students must take and pass the doctoral qualifying examinations according to the timeline given below. A student is considered to be a (qualified) candidate in the doctoral program upon passing the qualifying examinations. 9.2 Requirements for a doctoral degree The five basic requirements for the doctoral degree are: (1) the writing ability requirement, which all graduate students must satisfy; (2) the doctoral qualifying examination; (3) a major program of advanced study; (4) a minor program of study in a field different from that of the major; and (5) a thesis. Details of the five basic requirements are given below, followed by the rules (procedure, schedules, etc.) that pertain to the doctoral program. The program of study comprised of the major, minor, and additional supporting subjects will typically consist of at least 144 graduate-level credit units (12 subjects).

Up to a maximum of 12 units of subject 2.989 (Experiential Learning in Mechanical Engineering) may be counted towards the 144-unit credit requirement. Graduate-level subjects taken toward a Master’s degree may be used to satisfy the requirements of the doctorate. Graduate-level subjects taken at another graduate school may also be counted toward the MIT doctorate, if approved by both the Graduate Officer and the candidate’s thesis committee. The limit is 72 credit units for subjects taken outside MIT. 9.2.1 Writing ability requirement Students must successfully fulfill the writing ability requirement described in Section 4. 15 9.2.2 Doctoral qualifying examination The purpose of the doctoral qualifying examination (QE) is to determine whether the applicant possesses the attributes of a successful doctoral candidate at MIT: mastery of the mechanical/ocean engineering disciplines coupled with ingenuity and skill in identifying and solving unfamiliar problems. The QE serves to ensure that the ME PhD student (1) has maturity (cohesive and holistic view) in the disciplinary foundations of modern ME and closely-related disciplines, (2) has depth in an area and the breadth expected of mechanical engineers, (3) can think analytically and synthetically to construct rational and sound solutions to unfamiliar problems at an advanced level in engineering and engineering sciences, (4) can communicate effectively (including ability to organize thoughts), and (5) can respond reactively and cogently to questions or points raised in professional discussions and interactions; it also (6) enables ME faculty to collectively assess the students. The QEs are offered twice yearly (January and May) over a two-day period. Students are allowed to take the subject exams (SQE + RQE Part I) in a semester prior to taking the research skills exam (RQE Part II).

A student entering the graduate program with a Master’s degree must take both parts of the QE (for the first time) no later than the end of 3 regular semesters (fall and spring). In rare and extraordinary circumstances, a student may be granted one extra semester by the Graduate Officer. Petitions require a letter of support from the student’s thesis supervisor. Students who wish to discuss sensitive matters should feel free to contact the Graduate Officer directly or via the Graduate Student Ambassador, Professor Betar Gallant (bgallant@mit.edu). In order to be eligible to take the QE the student must have maintained a cumulative GPA of not less than 4.5 in the MIT graduate program.

RQE (Part I): a subject examination exploring the student’s depth of knowledge in the student’s chosen area of research, and 3. RQE (Part II): an examination of the student’s research skills. The QE takes place over two days and is organized as follows: Day 1: Three subject examinations, each consisting of a 30-minute oral exam. Two of these exams will be in two subject areas selected by the candidate and will comprise the student’s SQE. The third examination will be in the student’s chosen area of research and will comprise Part I of the student’s RQE. Day 2: Research Qualifying Examination-Part II, consisting of one 45-minute oral examination in the candidate’s field of research that explores the student's research skills. For the subject examinations, the student must pick 3 distinct areas from the approved lists below, choosing at least 2 from the C (core)-list and not more than 1 from the S (specialized)-list. The student must also indicate the one area that the RQE (Part-I and Part- II) is to be in. New subject areas may be added to these lists with one semester’s advanced notice; existing subjects may be removed, but only with a minimum of two years’ notice. During Part II of the RQE the student will: • Make a 25-min presentation of the student's original research (such as work for a previously completed SM thesis (at MIT or elsewhere) or initial work at MIT towards a doctoral thesis). • Respond to questions on that research for 20 minutes.

During Part II of the RQE the student will: • Make a 25-min presentation of the student's original research (such as work for a previously completed SM thesis (at MIT or elsewhere) or initial work at MIT towards a doctoral thesis). • Respond to questions on that research for 20 minutes. The student's advisor can be present during both parts of the RQE but is not permitted to participate in Part II of the exam. They may, however, participate in Part I. At least 2 weeks before the RQE, the student must provide the Graduate Office with a brief one-page abstract of the research presentation. This will help the faculty participating in the RQE anticipate and prepare for the specific knowledge domain(s) that will arise during each student's exam. The MechE Department faculty as a whole review and discuss each student’s performance in the qualifying examinations, together with their GPA and other holistic aspects of their performance in the graduate program at MIT, and make decisions regarding passing, being allowed to repeat the exams, or failing. Prior to review by the department faculty, scores are assigned by the exam committees for each student for each exam taken, with a score of 7/10 being a pass. Passing the QE requires passing Part II of the RQE, as well as any 2 (or more) of the 3 subject area examinations. Students who satisfy the nominal requirement for a pass in both the SQE + RQE Part I and RQE Part II exams pass the exam. These cases are usually not discussed. In the case of borderline failing performance, other 17 aspects of student performance in the graduate program, any special circumstances that may have adversely affected student performance in the exam, as well as the best interest of the student are typically taken into account in making the decision. Advisors who are not in MechE are also invited to these meetings, but they cannot participate in decision- making.

Examples of the major areas of some current students are: Biomedical Engineering, Computational Engineering, Design of Mechanical Products, Dynamical Systems, Interfacial Engineering, Materials, Nano- engineering, Ocean Acoustics, Renewable Energy & Water, and Robotics. The choice of area should be discussed with the Graduate Officer. The set of major subjects should bring candidates to the state of the art in their chosen field, insofar as that is possible via coursework. Candidates must satisfy their Doctoral Committee and the Graduate Officer that their proposed program meets this intent. The major represents the principal component of the candidate’s coursework. 9.2.4 Minor program of study The minor is a program of advanced study that develops competence in an area different from the candidate’s principal field of interest. Three subjects (not less than 24 units) must be taken in a coherent field different from the major. These subjects may be taken inside or outside the Department. If the minor is in an area of mechanical engineering or in mathematics, all three subjects must be at the graduate-level.

Any subsequent modifications must have the Graduate Officer’s approval. A minimum grade point average of 3.5 must be attained for the subjects that comprise the minor. 9.2.5 Doctoral Thesis The thesis is a major, original work that makes a significant contribution in its field. It is the principal component of the doctoral program, and the part that serves as the major indicator of a candidate’s abilities. The thesis is supervised by a faculty advisor and monitored by a doctoral thesis committee, which must include at least three MIT faculty members (including their advisor) with no conflicts of interest (e.g. members of the same family), and at least two of the three MIT faculty members must be MechE faculty.4 The doctoral committee is usually chaired by the thesis advisor, unless the advisor is not a member of the MechE faculty, in which case a MechE faculty member must chair the committee. At least one of the committee members must be from outside the extended research group with which the candidate is associated. The candidate may also invite qualified people from outside the MIT faculty to serve as additional members of the committee.

The candidate is responsible for initiating the various parts of the program and for keeping his/her Online Doctoral Program Record (informally called the “online History Card”) up to date; this may be found on the MechE Department website by navigating to Online Grad Card from the bottom of any page of the MechE website http://meche.mit.edu. The doctoral program milestones are as follows: 1. The candidate selects a field of principal interest, finds a faculty member who is willing to act as thesis advisor, and defines, at least tentatively, an area of research for the thesis. If the advisor is not in the MechE Department, the student must also find a faculty member from within the Department who will act as doctoral committee chair. 4 Includes Senior or Principal Research Scientists and Engineers who hold an appointment in the Mechanical Engineering Department and may supervise PhD students. Limited to one SRS/PRS per committee. 20 2. The candidate must meet with the Graduate Officer, in person, within one year of passing the qualifying examination. Topics to be discussed will include the tentative choice of thesis committee members along with the major and minor programs of study. 3. As soon as possible after that, and under no circumstances later than the end of the first year after passing the qualifying examinations, the student must form the thesis committee, having obtained prior approval of the membership from the thesis advisor and the Graduate Officer.

The names of the committee members should be entered on the online History Card. If a doctoral thesis committee has not been formed by the end of the first full year after passing the qualifying examination, a grade of U (Unsatisfactory) will be awarded for subject 2.THG at the end of the first semester in which it becomes overdue (and all subsequent semesters for which it is overdue). The committee is formed according to Section 9.2.5, Doctoral Thesis (above). In recruiting the most appropriate members for the thesis committee, it is often helpful (but not required) for the candidate to have a written document (a rough “pre-proposal”) describing preliminary ideas for the thesis research. The doctoral committee, together with the thesis advisor, will be the student’s primary source of advice and guidance. They will monitor and guide the research and act as mentors in the selection of the major, minor, and additional subjects as the student’s education evolves. Given that external circumstances (such as source of funding and expectations therefrom) may change, the thesis committee membership may be changed if necessary. 4. At the same time, and under no circumstances later than the end of the first year after passing the qualifying examinations, the student must have a doctoral thesis proposal in place. If a doctoral thesis proposal has not been submitted to the Graduate Office by the end of the first full year after passing the qualifying examination, a grade of U (Unsatisfactory) will be awarded for subject 2.THG at the end of the first semester in which it becomes overdue (and all subsequent semesters for which it is overdue).

It also serves to cultivate the ability to identify research problem(s) in the context of prior knowledge and art, design research in an appropriate context, and to express it clearly and comprehensively in a written document. The proposal should provide sufficient literature citations to indicate awareness of the broad field and previous work, and enough detail to show how the work is expected to advance the state-of-the-art. It is typically limited to six pages of text and figures (not including the cover page). The one-page cover should (only) include: tentative title of the thesis, student's name, brief abstract, keywords, and a list of the committee members indicating the Chair and/or Advisor, their official titles, departmental affiliations and email addresses. 21 The candidate must provide the Graduate Office with an electronic of the complete thesis proposal, and a separate electronic copy of the cover page only. Once these have been submitted, it should be so recorded on the online History Card. The Graduate Office will distribute copies of the cover page with the abstract to all MechE faculty.

Students must fulfill all of the MechE Department requirements as described above, and in addition satisfy the specific requirements of the particular interdisciplinary program. The interdisciplinary programs currently available include the following. 9.4.1 Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) The Computational Science and Engineering doctoral program enables students who work on computational thesis research to graduate with a doctoral degree in “Mechanical Engineering and Computation” (instead of the traditional “Mechanical Engineering” thesis field designation). Computational thesis research includes the development of new computational methods and/or the innovative application of computational techniques to important problems in engineering and science. This program is administered jointly by the MechE Department and the Center for Computational Science and Engineering.

This program is administered jointly by the MechE Department and the MIT Institute for Data, Systems and Society (IDSS). Enrolled students must complete coursework that satisfies the requirements of the MechE doctoral program as well as the IDPS requirements as outlined at https://stat.mit.edu/academics/idps/idps-meche/. They also need to produce a thesis that involves Statistics in a substantial manner. The student’s doctoral thesis committee, including the approval process for the thesis proposal, must include at least one faculty member from the Statistics and Data Science Center. For more information, please contact Professor Sapsis. 9.4.3 Joint Program with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution The Joint Program with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) is intended for students whose primary career objective is oceanography or oceanographic engineering. Students divide their academic and research efforts between the campuses of MIT and WHOI and receive a degree in Oceanographic Engineering. The program is described in detail at http://mit.whoi.edu/. 9.4.4 The Program in Polymers and Soft Matter (PPSM) The Program in Polymers and Soft Matter (PPSM) is an interdisciplinary program that offers Ph.D. students from five different departments, including Mechanical Engineering, 25 a core curriculum in the science and engineering of polymers and other soft matter systems. Faculty members affiliated with PPSM cover a wide range of research topics, including additive manufacturing, biomedical devices, computational modeling, and advanced synthesis. PPSM has its own set of qualifying exams and a doctoral candidacy process that takes the place of MechE's qualifying exams. Every semester, PPSM offers a seminar series featuring leading polymer science researchers from around the world, with participation expected from all PPSM students. PPSM requires its students",

PPSM students with MechE as their home department must also complete a minor in Mechanical Engineering, consisting of at least 3 MechE classes from at least two of the seven MechE Thrust Areas, with a grade of B or higher. Students enrolled in PPSM are expected to follow the same requirements and timelines as those in the MechE doctoral program, including taking a total of at least 144 graduate-level, letter-graded credit units. Graduate units from the Seminar in Polymers and Soft Matter (3.903/10.960) can be used to satisfy the 144-unit requirement. They are also expected to follow the post-qualifying exam processes described in section 9.3 of this guide, including having their major and minor program of studies approved by the MechE Graduate Officer. Upon completing their qualifying exams (either MechE or PPSM), PPSM students need to inform the MechE Graduate Office, which will proceed to create a History Card to be completed by the student and approved by the Graduate Officer following their meeting. For more information on the PPSM program, please visit the PPSM website http://polymerscience.mit.edu/ 10 Financial Support and Thesis Supervision 10.1 Types of financial aid available The Mechanical Engineering Department offers three types of financial assistance to graduate students: fellowships, research assistantships, and teaching assistantships. A fellowship provides students with a direct grant, and leaves them open to select their own research project and supervisor. A number of students in the Department are supported by fellowships from outside agencies, and a few are available from MIT. However, the Department itself has relatively few fellowships to offer.

The majority of students in the MechE Department are supported by research assistantships, which are appointments to work on particular research projects with particular faculty members. The faculty members procure research grants for various projects, and hire graduate students to carry out the research. The research is almost invariably structured so that it becomes the student’s thesis. A fulltime RA appointment provides a full tuition scholarship (i.e. covers all tuition) plus a salary that is adequate for a single person. In return for a fully funded education, RAs are required to do a certain 26 amount of work for the grant that funds them. In most cases, this work becomes the student’s thesis project. Consistent with this requirement, an RA may register for no more than 24 units of classroom work (typically two subjects) per regular term, and must do at least the equivalent of 24 units of thesis work (i.e. research on the project) per term. The summer term is usually spent on thesis work. Teaching assistants are appointed to work on specific subjects of instruction. As the name implies, TAs usually assist a faculty member in teaching, often grading homework problems and tutoring students. In the Mechanical Engineering Department, TAs are seldom used for regular full-time classroom teaching, but typically provide support to faculty instructors, conduct review sessions, hold office hours, or lead lab sections, etc. depending on the subject. TAs are limited to 48 units of credit per regular term with a maximum of 24 units of classroom work and cannot register for the subject that they are teaching. A TA appointment usually does not extend through the summer. The Associate Department Head for Education (currently John Leonard) oversees the TA allocation process. Information regarding TAs is communicated via email to Mechanical Engineering graduate students, typically toward the end of the fall semester for spring",

Information regarding TAs is communicated via email to Mechanical Engineering graduate students, typically toward the end of the fall semester for spring TAs, and in early summer for fall TAs. Experience has shown that the optimum graduate program consists of about equal measures of coursework and research, consistent with an RA appointment. One advantage of a fellowship is greater freedom in choosing a research project and supervisor. Another is that, unlike an RA, a fellowship student is not limited to two courses per term, and may therefore be able to finish a degree in a somewhat shorter time. A teaching assistantship gives the student teaching experience and can also be extremely valuable for reviewing basic subject material: for example, in preparation for the doctoral general exams. It does not, however, leave much time for thesis research, and may extend the time that the student will need to complete a degree. 10.2 How to get a research assistantship or teaching assistantship Once a student is formally admitted to the Department, s/he is eligible for an assistantship. At this point it helps to understand how the funding of graduate research works in MIT’s Engineering School. The faculty write proposals for specific research, and when they receive funding, they hire graduate Research Assistants to do the research with/for them. The MechE Graduate Office distributes a list of admitted students to all MechE faculty members, noting each student’s interests, previous university affiliation, grade point average, etc. Many faculty select candidates from this list for the positions they have available. (See also the paragraph after next.) They make their final selections after reviewing the students’ application files. At that point, they contact a student, with a specific offer for a research assistantship. A particular student may get offers from several professors, in which case he/she has to make a choice about which one to accept. The graduate research enterprise is thus somewhat like a free enterprise system,",

A particular student may get offers from several professors, in which case he/she has to make a choice about which one to accept. The graduate research enterprise is thus somewhat like a free enterprise system, with the individual professors looking for the best students for their research projects and the students looking for the most interesting or satisfying research experience. 27 What can students who have just been accepted do to improve the chances in this process? The first step is to carefully read the research areas as listed on the MechE website http://meche.mit.edu. From these areas students can identify the faculty members they would like to work with, and should not hesitate to write, e-mail, or telephone them; they should not be shy about making the professors aware of any special qualifications that they (the students) might possess (previous research experience, etc.). Students seeking research assistantships should be aware that many, if not most, commitments are made after April 15. Positions become available through the spring and summer, depending on when the research grants come in, and a significant fraction of new research assistantship offers are made after the beginning of the fall term. Most graduate students end up with funding by the end of their first term. Teaching Assistantships are relatively few in number, and are usually offered to students who are already at MIT and known to the departmental faculty. A student who has a keen interest in serving as a TA in a particular subject can make it known by contacting the faculty member in charge (listed in the MIT Bulletin under the description of each subject). 10.3 How to find a thesis supervisor if you have independent funding Students who have fellowships or are privately funded need to associate themselves with a faculty member who will supervise their thesis research. They should choose a supervisor in much the same way as another student would try to secure an RA, identifying prospective faculty members and checking whether there are projects they",

They should choose a supervisor in much the same way as another student would try to secure an RA, identifying prospective faculty members and checking whether there are projects they can work on. Research requires money, and even though these students require no salary from the Department, they are well advised to find a supervisor who has some funding for the intended work. Although their obligations to the research are not the same as those of an RA, in practice they end up working just as hard in order to finish their theses in a reasonable time. It is usually a good idea to associate with a supervisor as soon as possible after arrival at MIT. The student then becomes part of a research group, gets a desk to work at, and is in a position to get advice and learn from his/her supervisor and from the more experienced students in the research group. 10.4 Students with advisors outside the MechE Department A student whose research advisor is not a member of the Mechanical Engineering Department, must also choose an academic advisor from within the MechE Department. (See also Section 10.5.) This should be arranged in consultation with the research advisor and should be in place before the start of the student's second semester at MIT. The academic advisor could, for example, be the thesis reader for a Masters student and the thesis committee chair for a PhD student. S/he can provide guidance on taking classes, preparing for the doctoral qualifying examination, changes in Department policies, etc. 28 10.5 Students conducting their research at a site off-campus If a significant part of the student’s research is done off campus (e.g. at a hospital, Draper Lab, Lincoln Labs, etc.,), then both of the following conditions must be fulfilled: (a) The student must have a MechE faculty co-advisor from day-1 with whom the student meets, at least once a term, to describe to him/her the research progress.

A MechE faculty co-advisor is required even when a student (doing off-site research) has a MIT faculty co- advisor who is not a MechE faculty member. This involvement need not lead to the MechE faculty co-advisor being a co-author on any publication. (b) The off-campus supervisor must submit to the MechE faculty co-advisor and the Graduate Office, a short description of the project and expectations of the student. The MechE faculty co-advisor needs to be comfortable with that plan before the student starts any off-campus research. Each year thereafter, the off-campus supervisor must submit a report to the on-campus advisor describing the progress to-date and the path ahead. Additional MIT requirements are described at the website of the Office of the Dean for Graduate Education (ODGE): https://odge.mit.edu/gpp/degrees/ 10.6 Rules for students who do nonresidential doctoral thesis work off-campus All such students are required to have a MechE faculty member as either thesis supervisor or co-supervisor, and must have completed all requirements other than the thesis. (This includes having passed the doctoral qualifying examination, having submitted a thesis-committee-approved thesis proposal, and having the student's major and minor programs of study approved by the student's doctoral committee and the Graduate Officer.) Prior to embarking on work away from campus, a student must submit to the Graduate Officer a plan for finishing the degree, including thesis topic, timetable of academic courses at MIT, timetable of planned non-residential periods, and names and coordinates of off- campus supervisors. Both the thesis advisor and the Graduate Officer must approve the plan by signature. Students with off-campus co-supervisors (SM as well as PhD candidates) must arrange joint meetings with both their on- and off-campus supervisors at least once every regular term during this period of non-residency.
