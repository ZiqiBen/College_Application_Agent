  "raw_text": "Academics\nMaster's in Data Science\nMaster’s in Data Science Program Overview\nThe Data Science master's program, jointly led by the\nComputer Science\nand\nStatistics\nfaculties, trains students in the rapidly growing field of data science.\nData Science lies at the intersection of statistical methodology, computational science, and a wide range of application domains.  The program offers strong preparation in statistical modeling, machine learning, optimization, management and analysis of massive data sets, and data acquisition.  The program focuses on topics such as reproducible data analysis, collaborative problem solving, visualization and communication, and security and ethical issues that arise in data science.\nTo earn the Master of Science in Data Science, students must complete 12 courses. This requires students to be on campus for at least 3 semesters (one and a half academic years). Some students will choose to extend their studies for a fourth semester to take additional courses or complete a master’s thesis research project.\nYou can learn more about the Data Science program by watching the videos at the links below:\nVirtual Information Session for Fall 2025 Matriculation\nCurrent Master's Student Program Discussion, October 2024\nWhy pursue a master’s degree in Data Science?\nWith companies and organizations better able to capture data in a multitude of ways, data-driven decision making is changing the way businesses operate. Powerful analytics tools can model and predict how consumers will behave or markets will respond. Consequently, an understanding of data science is a 21st century job skill that can be beneficial in many different careers.\nData Science Degree Career Paths\nData Science career paths are flexible. There are different pathways to use data science skills.\nData science professional - data analyst, database developer, or data scientist.\nAnalytics-enabled jobs - functional business analyst or data-driven manager.\nData science professionals like data analysts can become qualified for a data science or data system developer role depending on where they deepen their expertise. By expanding knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, statistics, data management, and big data analytics, a data analyst can transition into a data scientist role. By building on existing technical skills in Python, relational databases, and machine learning, a data analyst can become a data system developer.\nRequirements\nThere are no formal prerequisites\nfor applicants to this master’s program. However, successful applicants do need to have a comfortable working knowledge of calculus, linear algebra and differential equations; familiarity with probability and statistical inference; fluency in at least one programming language such as python or R, and an understanding of basic computer science concepts. As Data Science is an interdisciplinary field, SEAS welcomes applicants with undergraduate training in a wide range of academic disciplines.\nHow to Apply\nLearn more about\nhow to apply to the Data Science degree program\nor\napply now\n.\nWhat should a graduate of the Data Science program be able to do?\nThe design of the program is based on eleven learning outcomes developed through discussions between the computer science and statistics faculty:\nBuild statistical models and understand their power and limitations\nDesign an experiment\nUse machine learning and optimization to make decisions\nAcquire, clean, and manage data\nVisualize data for exploration, analysis, and communication\nCollaborate within teams\nDeliver reproducible data analysis\nManage and analyze massive data sets\nAssemble computational pipelines to support data science from widely available tools\nConduct data science activities aware of and according to policy, privacy, security and ethical considerations\nApply problem-solving strategies to open-ended questions\nFinancing Your Degree\nStudents typically finance their master’s degree program with a combination of loans, savings, family support, grants (from governments, foundations and companies), fellowships and scholarships.

By requiring students to complete a substantial and challenging collaborative project, the capstone course will prepare students for the professional world and ensure that they are trained to conduct research. There will be no additional homework. There will be several mini-lectures, focusing on supplemental skills such as technical writing, public speaking, reading research papers, using version control software, identifying biases, etc. Since the projects concern real-world projects, datasets will likely be messy, and there is a focus on effectively communicating your progress to both the staff and partner organization. Course Website Computational Science and Engineering Capstone Project APCOMP 297R 2026 Spring Christopher Thorpe Wednesday 12:45pm to 3:30pm The capstone course is intended to provide students with an opportunity to work in groups of 3-4 on a real-world project. Students will develop novel ideas while applying and enhancing skills they have acquired from their core courses and electives.

Course Website Interdisciplinary Seminar in Applied Computation APCOMP 298R 2025 Fall This course examines sources of and mitigation frameworks for social bias in technology (with a special focus on generative AI). We examine social bias in tech in two ways: 1. by examining structural (e.g. cultural, social and institutional) factors underlying the low levels of diversity in decision making roles in technology, and 2. by examining the unequal social impact of technology in deployment. Through readings, students will gain familiarity with a wide range of previously identified structural challenges for achieving equitable representation in tech and fair outcomes when technology is integrated into social institutions. The focus of the course will be on identifying leadership opportunities and concrete strategies for making positive changes in tech communities (both inside and outside classroom) as well as in the way that technology is deployed, used, monitored and governed. In view of the roll-out",

In view of the roll-out of the EU AI Act(the world's first horizontal and standalone law governing AI) on August 1st 2024, this semester, we will take a special focus on connecting policy to technical research. Specifically, we will survey frameworks for discovering and quantifying social bias in ML/AI systems and explore ways that these technical tools can support enforcement of AI regulations. We will anchor our research to concrete goals and principles of the AI Act.
