If you are seeking a residency-based tuition discount, you must provide a copy of official documentation that includes your name and current address, e.g., driver’s license, voter identification card, recent utility bill, mortgage/lease agreement. If you are currently residing in a facility or are currently without permanent housing, a letter from the facility or homeless shelter where you receive mail may satisfy the proof of address requirement.\nShould you relocate, you must update your address within the PG Campus Student Portal within the first 30 days of moving to have your primary address updated. You may be asked to provide a proof of residency document for your new address. You must review your program page in this catalog\nand the\nState Licensure and Certifications\nsite in order to determine any applicable professional licensure requirements for your new primary address. Certain programs that are designed to meet professional licensure requirements in one state may have different requirements in another state. Once you have reviewed your program page\nand the\nState Licensure and Certifications\nsite, contact your Student Advisor should you have further questions.\nCriminal Background Check Requirements\nFor some programs, you may be required to undergo criminal background checks before starting classes; before you can be placed in an internship, externship, or at a clinical site; or before taking professional licensing, certification, or registration exams. If you have a prior felony conviction or serious misdemeanor, you may be denied the opportunity to take professional licensing, certification, or registration exams, or may be denied a license or certification to practice in some states, even if the exam is taken and successfully completed. Consequently, you may be denied admission to some programs.\nIf you are enrolling in a Purdue Global program that requires a criminal background check, you must submit a request for a criminal background check to the Purdue Global-approved vendor. If an approved background check is not on file with the University at least 2 days prior to your scheduled start date, you will need to defer your start date.\nAdditional Requirements for Undergraduate Programs\nYou must have earned a high school diploma or an approved equivalent. Complete\none\nof the following to meet this requirement:\nAttest to being a high school graduate.

Official transcripts must be received and processed by the Office of the Registrar.

Official transcripts must be received and processed by the Office of the Registrar. If the credential cannot be officially verified by 2 days prior to your scheduled start date, you will need to defer your start date.\n​​Special local and state programs allow current high school students to take individual courses at the University. You will be enrolled as a nondegree-seeking student until you have graduated high school and can complete the requirement outlined above.\nIf, for any reason, your evidence or attestation of high school graduation or its equivalent is found to be false, untrue, or otherwise unacceptable, you will be subject to immediate dismissal from the University, all credits earned will be invalidated, and the University will take all other appropriate actions. All aid disbursed on your behalf will be refunded to the appropriate source, and you will be responsible for payment of these funds to the original source or to Purdue Global, as appropriate.\nA bachelor’s degree is required to enroll in a postbaccalaureate certificate program, and other select programs require proof of a prior degree. Refer to your program’s policies for any additional requirements of this prior degree. You must provide an official transcript to the Office of the Registrar that shows completion of the required degree from an accredited institution, though an unofficial copy may be provided during the application process. If by the deadline you are unable to provide an official college transcript showing your prior degree completion, Purdue Global will attempt to use an unofficial transcript you provided during enrollment, and compare it to other official record sources, to confirm that the degree completion requirements for your program have been met. If the degree cannot be verified by 2 days prior to your scheduled start date, you will need to defer your start date.\nThe state of Indiana requires residents who are under the age of 21 during their first term of enrollment in a bachelor’s degree program to have graduated from high school completing an Indiana Core 40 curriculum or equivalent. If you are enrolling as an Indiana resident under the age of 21, a copy of an official high school transcript showing completion of the Core 40 or equivalent requirements, or comparable documentation for a nontraditional curriculum, is required prior to beginning class. If the credential cannot be officially verified by 2 days prior to your scheduled start date, you will need to defer your start date. If your high school curriculum does not meet the requirement of the Core 40 curriculum, you can also meet this admissions requirement by providing an official college transcript showing completion of at least 12 college-level semester credits (18 college-level quarter credits) with a grade of “C” or better.\nThe state of Maine requires all students born after 1956 and enrolled in an onsite degree program to provide proof of specific immunizations at the time of admission. If you are seeking admission to a Purdue Global location in Maine, you must submit proof of immunization against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, and tetanus. Proof of immunization must detail the administration of the following:\nA DT booster within the last 10 years\nAn adult MMR vaccination for individuals who previously received an MMR vaccination prior to their first birthday.\nIf you fail to submit documentation of the required immunizations, you will be denied admission to the University.\nAdditional Requirements for Graduate Programs\nA bachelor’s degree is required to enroll in a master’s degree or graduate certificate program, and a master’s degree is required to enroll in a doctoral or postgraduate certificate program. Refer to your program’s policies for any additional requirements of this prior degree. You must provide an official transcript to the Office of the Registrar that shows completion of the required degree from an accredited institution, though an unofficial copy may be provided during the application process. If by the deadline you are unable to provide an official college transcript showing your prior degree completion, Purdue Global will attempt to use an unofficial transcript you provided during enrollment, and compare it to other official record sources, to confirm that the degree completion requirements for your program have been met. If the degree cannot be verified by 2 days prior to your scheduled start date, you will need to defer your start date.\nIf you are applying to a graduate program, you must have achieved a 2.5 grade point average or higher in your bachelor's degree. If you do not possess a 2.5 CGPA, you may be considered for admission based on other evidence of academic potential.\nAcceptance to the University\nUpon completion of all admissions requirements, Purdue Global administration will review the information and inform applicants in writing whether they have been accepted for enrollment.\nIf you are not accepted, you will have no financial obligation to the University. If you are participating in the\nPurdue Global Commitment\ntrial period, you become financially responsible for any charges that you incur on your student account if you remain enrolled after the completion of the trial period. Questions regarding the admissions decision should be addressed to the Dean of the academic program to which you applied.\nReturning Students\nIn order to reenter the University, you must:\nMeet all admissions requirements for the program you wish to enter.\nComplete all standard admissions procedures.\nSupply all required documents.\nHave a clear student account.\nReentry to the University may require additional approval by the Dean of the school you wish to enter or the Dean’s designee if:\nYou have a history of conduct or behavior issues or a poor academic record.\nYou are returning to a graduate program and will be unable to complete the program within 7 years of completing the first class.\nYou were not in good academic standing when you last attended the University.\nIf you were not in good academic standing in your prior enrollment, you may appeal to the Dean of the school you wish to enter. Your letter of appeal should explain the circumstances that caused you to fall below the academic standards, what corrective actions you have taken to ensure success upon returning to your studies, and your desired start date.\nIf your appeal is approved, the approval will indicate the conditions of your return, including your status upon return and academic plan goals. If extenuating circumstances (e.g., death in the family, illness or injury, or other undue hardship) hindered your academic performance, then you may be approved to return academically eligible for financial aid in Financial Aid Warning (Academic Probation) status or Financial Aid Probation (Final Academic Probation) status. If you had not yet begun your Financial Aid Warning period in the last term of your most recent enrollment, you will be eligible to return on Financial Aid Warning for one term and continue on to Financial Aid Probation if you need more time to meet the academic standards and have met the term progress goals defined in your appeal approval. If you already began your Financial Aid Warning period, then you will return directly on Financial Aid Probation. If you did not experience extenuating circumstances, your appeal may still be approved if you have demonstrated that you have the academic potential to succeed upon return, but you may only be eligible to return in a financial aid ineligible status (Extended Enrollment). The Dean of the school will either confirm your desired start date or require additional time before you are allowed to reenter.\nA denied appeal is considered final and binding. You may not reappeal unless new information is presented for consideration.\nBack to Top\nPrint Options\nSend Page to Printer\nPrint this page.\nDownload Page (PDF)\nThe PDF will include all information unique to this page.\nDownload Current Catalog PDF\nThe PDF will include all information from the current edition of the catalog.\nCancel",
