MS students graduate with the flexibility to pursue careers in research, or to go on to doctoral study.\nNEW!\nThe MS-CS program is also offered in a\n4+1 year program format to Duke undergraduates\n, allowing them to complete the degree with a fifth year of study.\nThe department offers two program options for CS MS candidates: a course-only MS, or a project based MS. Both require 30 hours of course credits (10 courses), but the thesis/project option requires fewer credits from graded classes.\nBoth require an oral exam as a final milestone. For the course-only option, the exam is administered by a three-person committee appointed by the Department Chair. The course-only exam is based on a portfolio composed of research papers, project reports, presentations and other professional documents each student has produced during the course of the MS program.\nFor the project option, the student completes a research project under the supervision of a faculty advisor and a committee of 2 additional faculty members; a written report about the research describes the objectives of the work, the previous state of the art, the results obtained, and how to use the results of the project.  The student presents the report and defends the work in a public presentation before the committee.\nOptional Concentrations\nThe two optional concentrations for the MSCS degree are:\nArtificial Intelligence/Machine Learning\nCybersecurity\nIf a student completes\nthe requirements for a concentration\n, this will show up as an annotation on the student’s transcript. The concentrations are optional, and the student can get the MSCS degree without any concentration as well.\nWhat you should know before applying:\nThe CS MS has received an\naverage of 760 applications per year\nover the last 3 years and admits relatively few.\nThe department assumes admits are prepared to excel in rigorous computer science courses in the very first semester, and in fact, MS students take the same courses as PhD students.\nAn undergraduate major or minor in Computer Science is not mandatory, but a strong background in CS is. For example, students with degrees in Math or ECE and a strong background in CS often do very well.\nGraduates of the CS MS program will have the skills to create software and take an industry job as a software developer, but the program emphasizes computer science rather than software engineering.\nMS in Economics and Computation\nThe joint field of economics and computation has recently emerged from two converging intellectual needs, which has created the opportunity for a truly interdisciplinary program. in the short time since the program's founding, MSEC graduates have gone on to research jobs or PhD programs in CS, economics, finance, government, and business.
