  "raw_text": "Master's Programs\nDuke Computer Science offers a\nMaster of Science in Computer Science\nand a joint program with Economics, the\nMaster of Science in Economics and Computation (MSEC).\nMS in Computer Science\nThe MS program combines a firm grounding in theoretical foundations with training in current technologies and applications. MS students graduate with the flexibility to pursue careers in research, or to go on to doctoral study.\nNEW!\nThe MS-CS program is also offered in a\n4+1 year program format to Duke undergraduates\n, allowing them to complete the degree with a fifth year of study.\nThe department offers two program options for CS MS candidates: a course-only MS, or a project based MS. Both require 30 hours of course credits (10 courses), but the thesis/project option requires fewer credits from graded classes.\nBoth require an oral exam as a final milestone. For the course-only option, the exam is administered by a three-person committee appointed by the Department Chair. The course-only exam is based on a portfolio composed of research papers, project reports, presentations and other professional documents each student has produced during the course of the MS program.\nFor the project option, the student completes a research project under the supervision of a faculty advisor and a committee of 2 additional faculty members; a written report about the research describes the objectives of the work, the previous state of the art, the results obtained, and how to use the results of the project.  The student presents the report and defends the work in a public presentation before the committee.\nOptional Concentrations\nThe two optional concentrations for the MSCS degree are:\nArtificial Intelligence/Machine Learning\nCybersecurity\nIf a student completes\nthe requirements for a concentration\n, this will show up as an annotation on the student’s transcript. The concentrations are optional, and the student can get the MSCS degree without any concentration as well.\nWhat you should know before applying:\nThe CS MS has received an\naverage of 760 applications per year\nover the last 3 years and admits relatively few.\nThe department assumes admits are prepared to excel in rigorous computer science courses in the very first semester, and in fact, MS students take the same courses as PhD students.\nAn undergraduate major or minor in Computer Science is not mandatory, but a strong background in CS is. For example, students with degrees in Math or ECE and a strong background in CS often do very well.\nGraduates of the CS MS program will have the skills to create software and take an industry job as a software developer, but the program emphasizes computer science rather than software engineering.\nMS in Economics and Computation\nThe joint field of economics and computation has recently emerged from two converging intellectual needs, which has created the opportunity for a truly interdisciplinary program. in the short time since the program's founding, MSEC graduates have gone on to research jobs or PhD programs in CS, economics, finance, government, and business.

EGR 224 AND one of these: (This may be a good option for a student in ME) MATH 230/STA 230 MATH 340/STA 231 MATH/EGR 238L COMPSCI 250D COMPSCI 210D can be used in place of COMPSCI 250D. COMPSCI 210D, Introduction to Computer Systems, provides an alternative to COMPSCI/ECE 250 for Trinity CS majors; taking either course will satisfy the CS major requirement. Pratt ECE students are still required to take 250. (Other Pratt majors can likely take COMPSCI 210 or 250, but they should check with the DUS for their major.) The two courses share the general goal of introducing how programs execute and store information, and cover some of the same topics. However, COMPSCI 210D focuses on software systems aspects from a programmer's perspective whereas COMPSCI 250D focuses on hardware and processor design aspects. COMPSCI 210D introduces concepts that are broadly applicable across the many subfields of computer systems (big ideas in systems), with specific instances demonstrated through labs and assignments in the class.

Prerequisite: COMPSCI 201 or equivalent. COMPSCI 390-02 - Programming Languages | Instructor: D. Zhang / Whether designing systems, writing high-quality code or learning a new programming language, the ability to reason about language behavior and structure is a critical skill. This course equips students with the knowledge to not only use programming languages proficiently but also to understand why they work the way they do and how good language designs help programmers to build reliable code—an asset for anyone pursuing careers in software engineering, language design, or graduate study in computer science. This course provides a rigorous introduction to the fundamental concepts and design principles underlying modern programming languages and programming paradigms, including imperative, functional and object-oriented. Through analytical comparison, the course examines core topics such as language syntax and semantics, type systems, control structures, memory management, as well as cutting-edge language features, such as formal verification and static program analysis. Emphasis will be placed on both theoretical foundations and practical insights. By the end of the course, students will be able to critically evaluate language design choices, understand the trade-offs involved in language implementation, and apply this knowledge to write clearer, more reliable programs. Prerequisites: COMPSCI 201 and COMPSCI 230 (or COMPSCI 231D or COMPSCI 232).

COMPSCI 590-01 - Seminar in Computational Biology: Protein Structure & Drug Design using CS, AI, & ML | Instructor: Donald / The Nobel Prize was given last year for AI-enabled protein structure prediction and design. This year's seminar will focus on AI, Machine Learning, and algorithmic approaches to computational and experimental studies of protein structure and design. However, background material and fundamental basic science, algorithms, and computational methods will be covered in order to get to the foothills of this field. Some of the most challenging and influential opportunities for Physical Geometric Algorithms (PGA) arise in developing and applying information technology to understand the molecular machinery of the cell. Recent work shows that PGA techniques may be fruitfully applied to the challenges of structural molecular biology and rational drug design. Concomitantly, a wealth of interesting computational problems arise in proposed methods for discovering new pharmaceuticals. Recently, the intriguing success of Alpha Fold 3 from DeepMind of Google/Alphabet has energized the field to pursue machine learning techniques for protein structure prediction and molecular design. Among other topics, we will read some papers on these techniques from the intersection of machine learning and computational structural biology. This seminar course focuses on topics in computational biology. We will emphasize themes that unite algorithms, modelling, machine learning, or experimental results.

Frequently Asked Questions Who do I meet with if my first major is not COMPSCI? If you are a COMPSCI second major or COMPSCI minor, then you need to meet with your First Major Advisor to be cleared to register. If you are undeclared but planning on declaring for COMPSCI, please visit your first-year advisor until you have declared. Who do I meet with if I am doing study abroad? If you are away/studying abroad this semester, you will automatically be cleared for registration by the Study Abroad Office , but you are welcome to drop into CS registration clearance hours if you have questions. See the calendar above for the virtual drop-in hours offered by the CSTeach Registration Clearance Team. If you are planning on being abroad next semester and you have been approved for a study abroad program, you will need to meet with either one of the DUS's or with a member of the CSTeach Team for registration clearance. See the calendar above for the virtual drop-in hours offered by the CSTeach Registration Clearance Team. If you have not been approved yet, you should still bookbag and register for Duke courses just in case. Many COMPSCI courses fill up during the registration period, so if you do not go abroad, it would be difficult to add COMPSCI courses later. To do this, you will need to be cleared for registration. See the calendar above for the virtual drop-in hours offered by the CSTeach Registration Clearance Team. How do I add/drop/change my major, minor, concentration or certificate? Instructions and links for doing so are available on the registrar’s website . Note that no changes to academic plans will be processed by the registrar’s office during registration period.

Students can pursue independent study in computer science with a faculty member for research or non-research projects in a field of special interest. Students must complete the independent study form during the first one and a half weeks of the semester, but earlier is recommended. For SPRING 2026, all signed forms must be submitted to the DUS at dus@cs.duke.edu by January 16, 2026. More info about independent study is found on this page.

So Which Master's Option to Choose? Computer Science offers 3 different options for an MS degree: Course-Only, Research Project, and Thesis. Read the CS MS requirements so you are familiar with the basic course requirements. For explanation purposes here, we combine the Project and Thesis options into one, and refer to the Course-only and Project/Thesis options. Please note that when deciding between the Project or Thesis options, we generally recommend students pursue the Project option rather than the Thesis Option.

Please note that when deciding between the Project or Thesis options, we generally recommend students pursue the Project option rather than the Thesis Option. Most students pursue the Course-only option, finding it simpler to complete two additional Computer Science graduate courses, than to put together a committee and complete a research project or thesis. A Course-only MS will serve you well when you look for jobs in industry. There are, however, also good reasons to pursue the project/thesis MS option; chief among these is the value of experience in CS research for those wanting to pursue a Ph.D. A good relationship with a CS professor earned through strong work on a class project can lead to the opportunity to do a research based MS; do not say no to this opportunity! Research experience could make all the difference in your Ph.D. application, and can strengthen your industry application, too. The MS-CS program is also offered in a 4+1 year program format to Duke undergraduates , allowing them to complete the degree with a fifth year of study. Optional Concentrations The two optional concentrations for the MSCS degree are: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Cybersecurity If a student completes the requirements for a concentration , this will show up as an annotation on the student’s transcript. The concentrations are optional, and the student can get the MSCS degree without any concentration as well. Track Your Courses Make use of the convenient Course-Only Requirements Checksheet or the one for the Project/Thesis Option , to summarize the course requirements for each option in a table format. Organize and track your courses to be certain you meet the course requirement chosen.

They could be: More CS grad courses than you need More outside courses than you need Additional interests related to CS Ungraded research courses for the Project/thesis option You are trading two fewer CS grad courses for the work you are doing on your research project, but you still need to reach thirty hours. These credits are any P/F course credits such as EIS courses, or even extra academic courses you took; if you don't have either of those, look under \"R\" in the Class Search and find Ungraded Research. Ungraded research is a variable credit course, so be sure to enter the number of hours you need. Who approves your courses? The DGS office allows students to choose their own curriculum; as long as what you choose fits the guidelines above, everything is OK and we will not ask for Committee Approval. Students who want to pursue a job in Finance might take a Business course, and those interested in Computational Economics might need an Econ course; each student's needs and interests varies.
