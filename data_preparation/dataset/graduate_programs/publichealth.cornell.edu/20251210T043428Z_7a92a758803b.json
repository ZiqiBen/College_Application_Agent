View coursework View competencies Community-Engaged Learning Applied Practice Experience (APEx) The Applied Practice Experience (APEx) — designed in partnership with organizations across New York State, the United States, and around the world — is an opportunity for students to work with partner organizations and engage with a real-world public health project. Students apply knowledge and skills learned in the classroom, demonstrate competence, and contribute to public health, under the mentorship of a public health professional. To complete the APEx, students spend at least 120 hours on applied practice, either with one major project over the summer, or with a few smaller projects across semesters or breaks. As part of the APEx, students develop deliverables for partners and present their work in a public poster symposium. Deliverables might include outreach materials, summary reports, literature reviews, handbooks, lesson plans, stakeholder presentations, or another product requested by the partner. These deliverables also become part of each student’s professional portfolio. Learn more Integrative Learning Experience (ILE) In the final year of the Program, students develop a high-quality, substantive document written for a professional audience, that demonstrates integration of foundational and concentration-specific competencies. This Integrative Learning Experience (ILE) takes many forms. It could be a communication plan, training manual, policy white paper, evaluation framework, curriculum, or another substantive document that’s valuable to external stakeholders. The ILE can build on a student’s previous work with community partners, such as the APEx, or can focus on a new topic area.

Social Epidemiology Principles & Multilevel Influences on Health VTPEH 6102, 3 credits, Spring This course is rooted in a systems perspective. It connects behavioral theory to practice, so that students understand the complex array of factors that influence health. It provides a foundation in drivers of human behavior, which will ultimately help students better understand why a particular situation exists. The course also builds necessary background knowledge and skill that will aid in designing tailored, effective, culturally informed interventions. This course will reinforce and expand upon learning from Public Health Foundations I by addressing drivers of health and behavior, including individual, family, environmental, legal, institutional, cultural, and climate change. Conceptually, the course is guided by the Health Impact Pyramid, social determinants of health – with a particular emphasis on racism, discrimination and inequality – and an expanded socio-ecologic model. We draw on a lifecourse perspective, with particular attention to generational and cumulative impacts on populations. Through lectures, guided in-class activities, readings, discussion, guest speakers and case studies, students will further develop their public health competence and apply key concepts and systems thinking to assess domestic and global public health issues.

Finally, the course will examine strategies to reduce risk, build community resilience and adaptation to climate change. Disaster Policy & Politics VTPEH 6131, 3 credits, Spring This course helps students understand various political institutions, and how they influence disaster response and resilience. Policy requires politics: behind every positive or negative decision governments make, there are elected politicians, politically skilled officials, journalists, and other stakeholders. Understanding the world of politics is crucial to influencing and implementing policies- or even to understand the landscape in which any public health organization must operate. These political challenges are magnified during times of disasters, with new opportunities for competing incentives and things to go wrong. Understanding, engaging with and developing crucial strategic factors in public health emergency management requires navigating policy processes and political institutions. Crisis & Emergency Risk Communication VTPEH 6133, 3 credits, Fall This course builds students’ ability to communicate with the public and media during a public health crisis or emergency and conduct disaster preparedness PR campaigns to maximize trust and engagement, and to minimize harm.

For each method, students practice using these methods to explore a community-identified need. Cross-Sector Collaborations to Improve Health Equity VTPEH 6173, 3 credits, Fall The U.S. experiences persistent disparities in health status and health outcomes across race, gender, class, sexual orientation, gender expression, and other dimensions of individual and group identity. Cross-sector collaboration is a leading public health approach to addressing the complex and multiple factors that drive health disparities but has inherent challenges. To promote health equity in the communities they serve, healthcare, public health and social services organizations can work together to promote health equity (when everyone has the opportunity to attain their full health potential) by addressing the social determinants of health (e.g., food, housing, transportation). This class examines the challenges and opportunities faced by a local cross-sector collaboration that aims to advance health equity by integrating social care into the delivery of healthcare and optimizing care coordination throughout the care continuum. Supported by readings and lectures, this class is taught primarily through hands-on analysis of real-world data and participation in interprofessional teams. Students develop skills to work collaboratively with local leaders in the health system and in non-profit organizations that provide supportive services to Tompkins County residents. Students also strengthen their ability to analyze and interpret quantitative and/or qualitative data and develop evidence-based recommendations that leverage organizational strengths to maximize collaborative opportunities and mitigate cross-sector challenges.

The class will highlight two distinct approaches to case studies in global and public health, providing students with the unique opportunity to: 1) analyze global and public health challenges, policies and responses from different country and health systems perspectives 2) integrate the arts and humanities to deepen understanding of global public health issues, controversies and solutions, 3) develop problem solving, communication, critical reflection and interprofessional skills and 4) engage in active and participatory class discussions. Data Analysis with R VTPEH 6270, 2 credits, Spring This course guides students to proficiency in data analysis using R, equipping them with the skills to analyze quantitative data and create reports and interactive tools that support research, policy, and practice. Through weekly in-person lab sessions, students will participate in hands-on tutorials and collaborative debugging sessions to build essential coding and analytical proficiency. Key topics include data wrangling, visualization, simulation, statistical tests, and the development of interactive applications and reproducible reports. Students will gain experience with essential R packages such as ggplot2, lme4, rmarkdown, and shiny. Global & Public Health Policy Case Study Development VTPEH 6193, 2 credits, Fall Graduate Research in Public Health VTPEH 6990, 1-4 credits, Spring or Fall Research credits with public health program faculty may include topics of public health and environmental change, food security, local agriculture, civic engagement, health equity, social justice, environmental justice.

Contact faculty in the program directly to inquire about available research topics/projects. Competencies All students are assessed on a total of 40 competencies throughout their course of study and must be competent in these areas to graduate. Thirty-four competencies are predetermined by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH) , and our Program requires an additional five competencies for each concentration, as well as one for professional writing. One specific deliverable or series of deliverables is used as the main point of assessment for each Foundational and Concentration competency. Students are expected to track their progress in each competency area as they complete the relevant coursework, as demonstration of each is required for graduation. As a part of this, students synthesize core, concentration, and writing competencies in applied projects, such as the Applied Learning Experience (APEx) and the Integrative Learning Experience (ILE).
