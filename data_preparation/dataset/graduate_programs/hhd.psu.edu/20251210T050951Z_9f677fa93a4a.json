Students will be allowed to enroll conditionally in courses that require prerequisites if, based on their current official enrollment, they will satisfy these course requirements prior to the time courses requiring prerequisites begin. Students wishing to take a course for which they do not have the prerequisites should consult with their assigned CSD Academic Adviser about the appropriateness of their request. If you do not have an assigned CSD Academic Adviser, please email csdinfo@psu.edu . An exception to published prerequisites will be considered by requesting a prerequisite override in LionPATH ( download instructions ). Requests are evaluated in consultation with the academic adviser and faculty member teaching the course. If approved, the student will be notified and will complete enrollment via LionPATH. Please review the College of Health and Human Development procedures on course disenrollment for students who fail to successfully complete the enforced prerequisites.

Some graduate schools require students to take the GRE for admissions, and in those cases, we recommend taking MATH 21 : College Algebra I (3 cr) prior to taking the GRE to refresh math concepts that will be tested on the exam. Students who choose not to take the GRE may select any GQ of interest and can review the math course descriptions for more information. MATH 32 : Math for Allied Health Professions and MATH 34 : The Mathematics of Money are popular selections for CSD students. GN-Natural Science To gain entry into graduate programs in Speech-Language Pathology or Audiology, ASHA (but not Penn State) requires a human biological science and a physical science (physics or chemistry), so GN courses should be selected accordingly. Suggested courses include: Human Biological Science BISC 2 : Genetics, Ecology and Evolution (3 cr) BISC 4 : Human Body: Form and Function (3 cr) BIOL 133 : Genetics and Evolution of the Human Species (3 cr) BIOL 155 : Introduction to the Biology of Aging (3 cr) Physical Science CHEM 1 : Molecular Science (3 cr) - fall only CHEM 101 : Introductory Chemistry (3 cr) - not offered at University Park CHEM 130 : Introduction to General, Organic, and Biochemistry (3 cr) PHYS 1 : The Science of Physics (3 cr) - offered via the DLC for CSD students GA-Arts and GH-Humanities Students are free to choose any course of interest in these categories. See the suggested electives list for ideas. We recommend CI 280 : Introduction to Teaching English Language Learners (3 cr) to fulfill GH-Humanities, as this is a required course for future certification as a school SLP.

CSD Suggested Electives The CSD major includes 30-36 credits of electives which allows students to customize their studies to their interests. Students may choose any course of interest to fulfill elective credits and are not limited to the selections on this page. The categories below are offered as suggestions and have been curated to emphasize the skills and knowledge needed to be successful as speech-language pathologists and audiologists. Students are advised to check prerequisites for all courses.

This video highlights the experience of students enrolled in CSD 240: Supporting Communication Through the Performing Arts in Spring 2022 at Penn State, University Park, PA. What You Can Expect CSD 240 allows students to acquire skills, knowledge, and experiences about the ways in which performance activities such as improvisation, vocal performance, and dance can promote valued communication and developmental outcomes for individuals with and without developmental and intellectual disabilities. The course is explicitly designed to include students from the Lifelink PSU program who have intellectual disabilities, who learn with and alongside enrolled students. This structure directly emphasizes the interconnections between students with and without disabilities, as well as between the knowledge bases and theoretical approaches brought by specialists in the performing arts and in diverse areas of disability services. Although the units change year to year, we cover a range of performance types including improvisation, vocal performance, West African Dance and Drumming, Salsa, dance, etc. We also always have a Master Class with professional visitors who are touring through the Center for Performing Arts. CSD 240 is approved for use in General Education as a GS-Social and Behavioral Science. All majors and skill levels are welcome to participate! Faculty The course is co-taught by Krista Wilkinson , professor of communication sciences and disorders, College of Health and Human Development and Michele Dunleavy , associate professor of dance, School of Theatre.

Capstone: Mentored research experience We believe the foundation of being an excellent SLP is the ability to read, understand, and use research to provide evidence-based assessments and interventions for our clients. To foster your skills in research, all M.S. students will complete a mentored, research-based capstone experience alongside our research faculty. Students have the option of completing a thesis or a master’s student research paper. Starting in the fall semester, students will work with a research advisor from one of our active research programs in areas such as: Augmentative and alternative communication Autism Developmental language disorders Somatosensory processing Speech production Aphasia Dysphagia Students will continue to work with their advisor to complete a research project that may be conducting a qualitative or quantitative research project, analyzing existing research data, or writing a literature review. They will be guided through their research project over the course of four semesters. The master’s student research paper is due prior to going out on the final externship experience. All of my professors and supervisors have been more than supportive in guiding me through my journey in graduate school. They are always there when I have a question or need a shoulder to lean on!

Rather, pursuing a doctoral degree provides the opportunity for students to participate in a wide range of faculty research, colloquia, informal seminars, discussion groups, conferences, etc. Pursuing a doctoral degree sets the stage for lifelong learning and scholarship. Each doctoral student has the opportunity to develop an individualized program of study approved by the student's doctoral committee. Typically, this program of study involves: An area of specialization within the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders (the major content area) At least two related areas of study in the field of communication sciences and disorders At least one related area of study outside the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders Methodology and statistics requirements Language/communication requirements Graduates of the program will be prepared to assume careers as researchers and scholars at colleges, universities, and research institutes. The Ph.D. program is not an advanced clinical degree; it is conferred in recognition of the attainment of the highest academic excellence and productive scholarship. All students will complete, at a minimum, three projects: a first (Qualifying Exam), second (Comprehensive Exam), and third (Dissertation) doctoral project.
