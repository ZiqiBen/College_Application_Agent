Penn State dictates that each three-credit course requires approximately 10 hours of work each week on the part of the student. The amount of hours spent each week may vary, depending on your learning style, speed, and aptitude. You should not expect the rigor of the Online MBA to be any less than an MBA earned on campus.\nAs an applicant with an international transcript that requires credential review, which organization should I use?\nThe J. Jeffrey and Ann Marie Fox Graduate School at Penn State will not review the academic credentials of a prospective student until an application is officially submitted. If you feel strongly about having your credentials verified before completing and submitting your application, you may have your credentials reviewed by\nEducational Credential Evaluators (ECE)\n. Approval from ECE will assure you are academically eligible for not only our program but most other U.S. Institutions as well. Please note the Penn State Fox Graduate School does not accept credential reviews from World Education Services (WES); only reviews done by ECE.\nAs an international applicant, how do I know if I’m eligible for admission?\nTo view the admission Eligibility requirements from a selected country, visit the\nFox Graduate School's \"Requirements for Graduate Admission\" page\n. If you have questions about acceptable official transcripts, visit the Fox Graduate School’s “\nTranscripts/Records Frequently Asked Questions\n” page.\nIf I have a lower than average GPA, will I still be considered? How do I demonstrate my ability to succeed in the program?\nWe will use other parts of your application to assess your overall potential for success in the program, with a particular focus on the quantity and quality of your professional work experience. Additionally, if you have had any subsequent graduate-level classes (especially those of a quantitative nature), we will consider those in our overall evaluation of your application.\nWhy is the team performance immersion required?\nThe team performance immersion is required, as about 25% of the core team performance course (MBADM 810) is taught during this virtual session. Participating in the immersion is essential to connect students with faculty, staff, peers, and resources, which will set them up for success throughout their course of MBA study. While the program is very flexible, it is crucial everyone starts with the same foundational programming.\nIs financial aid available?\nMany online learners also discover that their employer will subsidize a portion of the tuition as part of an employee’s total benefits package. Flexible payment plan options are also available. Please contact us at\n[email protected]\nto discuss your options.\nCan I earn another Penn State master’s degree while pursuing my Online MBA?\nAbsolutely! We have many students ask about pursuing a second degree or certificate concurrently. Most online MBA program concentrations are structured so that they not only serve as MBA electives, but also serve as part of a certificate program, and for some, a full master’s program as well. Depending on your career goals, you may be able to complete a second course of degree study (or add an extra class or two and receive a certificate) concurrently with the MBA with significantly less investment in time and finances than would be required if you completed the courses of study separately. You may also be able to pursue a concurrent degree in academic areas outside of what is offered via the Online MBA concentrations.\nIf you wish to pursue a concurrent degree or certificate, please contact the Penn State Online MBA’s Managing Director, Stacey Dorang Peeler, at\n[email protected]\n.\nWhat exactly is the ICE learning methodology?\nWhat will my diploma say?\nYour diploma will display The Pennsylvania State University, Master of Business Administration.

Depending on your career goals, you may be able to complete a second course of degree study (or add an extra class or two and receive a certificate) concurrently with the MBA with significantly less investment in time and finances than would be required if you completed the courses of study separately. You may also be able to pursue a concurrent degree in academic areas outside of what is offered via the Online MBA concentrations. If you wish to pursue a concurrent degree or certificate, please contact the Penn State Online MBA’s Managing Director, Stacey Dorang Peeler, at [email protected] .

October 27, 2021 By Mike Dawson A team at Penn State is taking a deep dive into some of its graduate courses by studying the data that show how students learn and behave. They hope to use their findings to redesign courses in ways that will help students be more successful online learners.

The team of instructional designers, faculty, and teaching support specialists has been analyzing these learning analytics from two years’ worth of courses in the Penn State Online MBA , which is offered through Penn State World Campus and led by the Smeal College of Business. The data consist of an expansive variety of activities, from the links students click to the depth and quality of the posts they write on discussion boards. The data will be used to guide an innovative approach to course design, aligning the program’s main learning goals to the ways the team wants students to act and engage in the courses. The work in the online MBA courses is the first of its kind at Penn State and among the first in online graduate higher education in the country. “The data represent a study of student behaviors based on the unique graduate level teaching and learning experience and tell us a story about what is happening in our courses,” said Janet Duck, the online MBA faculty chair who has championed the project. “We can use this story, through deliberate course design, to inspire student behavior that solidifies course competencies and provides an engaged experience for our professional students.” A never-before-seen look into courses With almost 1,000 students, the Penn State Online MBA is the highest-enrolling graduate program offered through Penn State World Campus. The program is led by the Smeal College and includes a consortium of faculty from Penn State Behrend, Penn State Harrisburg, and Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies. It has consistently ranked among the top-10 online MBA programs in the country by U.S. News & World Report . For the past two years, the team has been collecting data from the 13 core online MBA courses in Canvas, the University’s learning management system, and Zoom.

The data are being visualized on a dashboard using charts, tables, and graphs. Jessica Resig, the lead instructional designer for business programs offered through Penn State World Campus, said this approach lets the team see the students’ behaviors in a new way. For instance, the data may show trends, such as if students are struggling with a concept as evidenced by low grades on the same assessment each semester. Or they could see whether students are choosing to watch videos that are included in their weekly lessons but are not required viewing. “Those kinds of things can give us insights about where students are spending their time or where they're engaging with our material, to help us make decisions about if the content is meeting their needs,” Resig said. “This is a comprehensive snapshot that’s presented in a way that we didn’t have before.” Resig said students’ privacy is paramount in the data collection. “Our goal is to understand the effectiveness of each course and the design decisions we're making, not to focus on individual course participants,” Resig said. “With that in mind, we aggregate all data used as part of the course analysis process and have implemented a robust set of ethical and procedural standards to ensure that student privacy and data security are strictly maintained.” This screenshot from the online MBA team's learning analytics dashboard shows data relating to how students engage with course content. Re-envisioning course improvement Designers hope the learning analytics will mean they can make ongoing improvements to the online MBA courses as needs arise instead of waiting until courses are scheduled for updates every few years. Duck said that even though the team has just started to analyze the data, the learning analytics are already pointing to improvements and a more holistic understanding of teaching and learning. For instance, the study of the depth of replies on discussion boards shows that when students write long discussion board posts, those posts tend to attract fewer replies. The data show which content pages students are visiting the most and places where student engagement tends to drop, Resig said. “Are there ways that we can redirect them to that course content?” Resig said. “Can we re-envision the way the content",

We want engaged, applied, and integrated learning, and data can help us get there.” This screenshot from the online MBA team's learning analytics dashboard visualizes data about students' discussion boards and participation. Spreading the word outside of Penn State Resig and Duck are sharing their knowledge with their peers in online learning across the country, and Duck said she receives inquiries about these efforts. Resig and Chris Millet, the senior director of learning design for Penn State World Campus, led a virtual presentation in September on learning analytics during the Online Learning Consortium’s OLC Accelerate conference, one of the largest meetings of online education practitioners. Resig and Millet have authored two book chapters in scholarly publications about this use of learning analytics. Duck and Resig will lead a virtual presentation on the topic in November during the Quality Matters Connect LX conference. Resig said another group of online MBA courses will be revised next fall, and the last group in the program will be revised in the fall of 2023. Afterward, the team expects to use the dashboard to spot trends or warnings in the learning analytics and make continuous improvements in the course content. That is why the data-backed approach to learning design has the potential to be so transformational. “It lets us be smarter and",
