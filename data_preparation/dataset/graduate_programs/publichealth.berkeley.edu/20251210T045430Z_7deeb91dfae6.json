Biostatistics MA and PhD applicants must submit GRE scores for the upcoming cycle. Minimum GRE Scores We do not have a minimum GRE score as we review applications holistically; however, competitive applicants tend to score in the 50th percentile and above. Many program pages include the average GRE scores of admitted students for that specific program. How to submit scores While you can take your exam as late as the date of the deadline, we recommend that you plan to take your exam no later than October to allow time for scores to arrive in time for consideration for fall admission. At-home test scores are acceptable. All applicants who submit GRE test scores must send official scores through ETS directly to UC Berkeley. Please use code 4833 . Scores must be from within 5 years of the test date for them to be considered valid. In order to apply, you must retake the test if your scores are more than five years old.

Letters of Recommendation Berkeley Public Health’s Admissions Committee requires that a minimum of three letters of recommendation be submitted electronically to your UC Berkeley Graduate Application. We recommend that you request that your letter writers use an official letterhead. Typically, we recommend you have at least one letter of recommendation from an academic and two from individuals who can evaluate your professional experience. However, please thoroughly look at the requirements and qualifications of the program you are applying to for more guidance. Overall, it will be in your best interest to have three individuals who can attest to your academic and/or professional ability to succeed in a public health career. For academic references, we recommend you ask professors who you think will write the strongest recommendations. A strong quality letter attesting to your ability to succeed in the program will weigh more than a generic letter from a high-ranking professor. Berkeley Public Health does not accept hard-copy letters sent to our offices. Requesting Recommendations In the application’s Recommendations section, enter the contact information for each recommender and send the email requests. (If your recommender does not receive the request, contact sphadmit@berkeley.edu ) Recommenders will upload letters directly to your application.

It involves the investigation of all systems that affect population health, not just the medical care system. The purview of health policy is global. The mission of our program is to prepare students for research careers in health policy and health services research; teaching; and public service in university, governmental and public policy settings. This program is distinguished by its interdisciplinary application of the social and behavioral science disciplines to real world health issues. Graduates are prepared to play lead scientific roles in addressing the many challenges facing health care and public health systems in the United States and countries around the world. Curriculum Students must successfully complete a health services research readings and methods seminar (two semesters), five specialty field courses, three quantitative research methods courses, and three additional graduate elective courses. The program includes three specialty fields: Health Economics specialty field The Health Economics specialty field draws on economics, epidemiology and statistics to understand the causal relationship between different aspects of health and the health care sector. With an emphasis on quantifying relationships, health economics covers a broad range of study areas including health production, demand and supply of health services, health care financing, behavioral responses to institutional or policy incentives, policy evaluations and other efficiency, and equity issues surrounding health.

Organizations & Management specialty field The Organizations & Management specialty field trains scholars in organizational behavior and political science in regards to health. Theories and methods in organizational sociology, political science and social psychology are central to the study of health organizations. Specialty field courses in macro-organizational theory, micro-organizational theory and organizational analysis of the health sector are required. This specialty field emphasizes the management of health care and public health organizations and systems, the implementation and dissemination of policies and practices within and across organizations, and the role of policy-making institutions as platforms for the creation and modification of health policies. Population Health Sciences specialty field The Population Health Sciences specialty field trains students for research careers in the social, behavioral, and economic determinants of health and the study of interventions, policies, and practices that impact the health of populations and vulnerable communities. The specialty field emphasizes addressing the social and behavioral determinants of health through quantitative research informed by theoretical frameworks in economics, psychology, demography, and social epidemiology. Training in innovative methodologies for establishing causal relationships in quasi-experimental research is a cornerstone of the Population Health Sciences specialty field. Students will learn and integrate cutting-edge methods from key areas of strength at Berkeley: biostatistics, social science methods such as econometrics and formal demography, and the rapidly evolving set of data science innovations such as machine learning that are being advanced at Berkeley including in the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society. The explosion of health sector data availability, along with Berkeley’s innovation hub positioning, make this an excellent track for students looking to become quantitative experts who can lead research across a wide variety of population health science and health policy questions.

Our goal is to improve public health by increasing our understanding of infectious diseases and human immunology through basic and translational research that contributes to developing new diagnostics, treatments, and methods to prevent or control diseases. Because the IDI Graduate Group is administratively managed by the School of Public Health, we follow the School of Public Health application process and deadlines . GRE test scores are not required for the Infectious Diseases and Immunology PhD program. Program Objectives The objective of this program is to provide students with research-oriented training that will enable them to design and implement independent investigations and advance the fundamental knowledge of infectious disease agents and their interactions with the human host and the environment. The IDI PhD program is a five-year program. Students in the program are fully funded throughout their time in the program, and are provided with a competitive monthly stipend. We strive to promote",

The IDI PhD program is a five-year program. Students in the program are fully funded throughout their time in the program, and are provided with a competitive monthly stipend. We strive to promote health by integrating basic research and applied technologies to develop new approaches for the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control of infectious disease in humans. This program combines clinical, epidemiological, and basic laboratory research strategies in order to apply these methods to specific infectious disease problems affecting human populations. In addition, students have opportunities to interact with faculty members from multidisciplinary centers involved in global infectious disease research. These include the Center for Global Public Health and the Center for Emerging and Neglected Diseases. Students matriculating through this program will acquire expertise in not only fundamental infectious disease research, but also learn how their research relates to other disciplines. Students matriculating through this degree program will acquire expertise in fundamental infectious diseases research for which there is demand from academic institutions, local and national government agencies, and biotechnology companies. Our Commitment to Belonging The graduate students and faculty of the Infectious Disease and Immunity Program stand with Black Lives Matter. We believe that racism and police violence is a public health crisis that deserves the same amount of attention and work as any other disease. As students of Public Health and Biology, we understand the ways in which our field and institutions have been complicit and contributed to the harm perpetuated against Black bodies. The popularized pseudoscience of phrenology, the grotesque distortion of evolution into eugenics, and the irreparable harm of the Tuskegee Syphilis study are just a few examples of how science and public health have perpetuated white supremacy in both mind and body. We are dedicated to creating an academic environment free of anti-Blackness and making our program and community places where Black, Indigenous, and other URM students can thrive. This is a lofty goal and we recognize that it will take more than a passing attempt to root",
