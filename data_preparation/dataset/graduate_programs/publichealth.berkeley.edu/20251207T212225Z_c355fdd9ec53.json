GRE test scores are optional for the Infectious Diseases and Immunity PhD. They are also optional but strongly recommended for the Epidemiology PhD, Environmental Health Sciences PhD, and Health Policy PhD. Biostatistics MA and PhD applicants must submit GRE scores for the upcoming cycle. Minimum GRE Scores We do not have a minimum GRE score as we review applications holistically; however, competitive applicants tend to score in the 50th percentile and above. Many program pages include the average GRE scores of admitted students for that specific program. How to submit scores While you can take your exam as late as the date of the deadline, we recommend that you plan to take your exam no later than October to allow time for scores to arrive in time for consideration for fall admission. At-home test scores are acceptable. All applicants who submit GRE test scores must send official scores through ETS directly to UC Berkeley. Please use code 4833 . Scores must be from within 5 years of the test date for them to be considered valid. In order to apply, you must retake the test if your scores are more than five years old. If the GRE is optional for your program and you choose not to submit scores, we recommend that you highlight your verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing skills that prepare you for the specific program to which you are applying in your application and statement of purpose. This can be completed coursework, such as undergraduate or post-baccalaureate math/stats or epi/biostats courses, quantitative research, data analysis, or evaluation experience, verbal/writing strengths such as professional publications and/or presentations, etc.).

You may also submit a writing sample or other supporting documents. Letters of Recommendation Berkeley Public Health’s Admissions Committee requires that a minimum of three letters of recommendation be submitted electronically to your UC Berkeley Graduate Application. We recommend that you request that your letter writers use an official letterhead. Typically, we recommend you have at least one letter of recommendation from an academic and two from individuals who can evaluate your professional experience. However, please thoroughly look at the requirements and qualifications of the program you are applying to for more guidance. Overall, it will be in your best interest to have three individuals who can attest to your academic and/or professional ability to succeed in a public health career. For academic references, we recommend you ask professors who you think will write the strongest recommendations. A strong quality letter attesting to your ability to succeed in the program will weigh more than a generic letter from a high-ranking professor. Berkeley Public Health does not accept hard-copy letters sent to our offices. Requesting Recommendations In the application’s Recommendations section, enter the contact information for each recommender and send the email requests. (If your recommender does not receive the request, contact sphadmit@berkeley.edu ) Recommenders will upload letters directly to your application. Please notify your recommenders to look out for the email request with instructions. You can submit your application before your letters are uploaded. However, we encourage you to follow up with your recommenders to ensure that they submit their letters before the deadline. Note: The Letterbanc service cannot be used for this program.
