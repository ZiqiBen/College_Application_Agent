Sign up for the appropriate CPT course. 2. At the beginning of the quarter, you will receive an email to log in to the CPT database. You must verify your basic information (e.g. email address, advisor name, etc). 3. At the end of your CPT, upload your final report to the CPT database . Your report needs to be submitted by the last day of class, even if your internship has not ended, yet. 4. Reports will be routed for adviser approval. You are responsible for ensuring that your faculty reviews and signs your report. 5. Reports will be routed to the Associate Chair for Graduate Education for final approval. *Please see note below. 6. Final grades will be entered. *An incomplete (\"I\") grade will be assigned if the report is not finally approved by the Associate Chair by the grade due deadline.

New & Popular Undergraduate Courses The structure of our curriculum provides undergraduate students with great flexibility, allowing for earlier completion of a co-term, earning a double major, or taking courses outside of electrical engineering (EE). Our undergraduate curriculum also introduces application of EE fundamentals earlier in the bachelor of science (BS) program; fosters the maker culture in EE education; and teaches all engineering students about basic electrical engineering tools. Check out our newest and most popular courses below!

Networks form interconnects that stitch together our digital and physical lives. They underpin cloud computing, our mobile connectivity, as well as the means to connect the large number of sensors that will pervade our physical surroundings. Professor Sachin Katti will teach these concepts through a project that involves building a wireless network from the ground up using software radios. Students will also learn how to use these networks to build embedded applications (e.g. wireless controlled network of drones, localization systems using WiFi). The goal is to introduce students to larger concepts in electrical engineering and computer systems: the role of abstraction and layering, building reliable systems out of unreliable components and dynamic sharing of scarce resources.

Understand the behavior of diodes, transistors, capacitors, and inductors in application. Taught by Professor Juan Rivas-Davila , this course focuses on the circuits used to efficiently convert AC power to DC power, step DC power from one voltage level to another, and convert DC power to AC power. The components used in these circuits (e.g., diodes, transistors, capacitors, inductors) are also covered in detail to highlight their behavior in a practical implementation. A lab held with the class will give students hands-on experience with power electronic circuits. The class also has a final project that requires a math design, simulation, implementation and experimental verification.
