This concentration utilizes a range of analytical tools and the ability to take an integrative point of view within a framework of decision-making that focuses on multiple disciplines. Students will understand how to integrate functions such as finance, law, operations, marketing, etc., all within the context of strategy. Tepper School MBA students will become comfortable integrating coursework from other areas/concentrations to use their analytical skills to perform in-depth analyses of industries and competitors, predict competitive behavior, and analyze how firms develop and sustain competitive advantage over time. Topics among various concentrations include, but are not limited to, consulting and conflict resolution, managing intellectual capital and knowledge-intensive business, strategic corporate management, technology strategy, trade, and investment strategy. Sustainability* Our MBA Sustainability concentration encompasses a wide range of topics including energy, natural resources, the environment, health and social well-being, engineering, and architecture. The essence of sustainability is considering the impacts of actions today on outcomes in the future. As an outgrowth of the Tepper School Sustainability Initiative and in response to increasing demand for sustainability studies, the MBA Sustainability concentration offers students an opportunity to pursue scholarship, coursework, and careers in this ever-growing field. Both the initiative and concentration draw from the existing sustainability expertise among faculty within the Tepper School and across the university and the university-wide focus on technology, quantitative and computational approaches, and energy topics.

Business Analytics Energy and Sustainability* Entrepreneurship Management of Innovation and Product Development* Technology Strategy and Product Management Capstones Capstones are immersive, experiential courses at the end of your Tepper School experience. Options include working alongside corporations or participating in a strategic management exercise. Management Game is offered in the online format; Strategic Management of the Enterprise is available to students who can take classes on campus. Management Game We train prospective managers to solve open-ended problems with talented people in creative ways. The Management Game is an applied strategic management and general management experience in which teams of students operate computer simulated companies for three years, acting as the executive committee of a multinational manufacturing company. Through this simulated management exercise, students are equipped to solve open-ended problems in innovative ways. The class takes place at the end of the curriculum and illustrates how to apply the tools acquired in other classes in a complex international business environment. The main focus of the learning is the unstructured nature of the problem. How It Works Teams of students compete against each other as they work to add value to their companies while learning about competitive dynamics, group management skills, cross-functional management, and team leadership skills. The class is unique in that students are evaluated primarily by external professionals and by the results they deliver. What matters is not how hard they work but how effectively they work. The project’s externally-focused exercises are relevant to team members’ career choices and include interactions with industry partners. Some examples include negotiating a labor agreement with union representatives or presenting marketing plans to marketing executives. The opportunity to practice",

Some examples include negotiating a labor agreement with union representatives or presenting marketing plans to marketing executives. The opportunity to practice and receive feedback directly from corporate partners is both unique and valuable to the learning process. Each team reports to an external board of directors and must defend their plans and outcomes to advisors who evaluate their performance. Alumni and friends of the Tepper School volunteer to serve on the board of directors, offering their expertise and experience. The board meetings occur three or four times throughout the capstone experience, serving as an interactive feedback session for the team. The external feedback and evaluation structure of the course makes the exercise sharply realistic. The highly unstructured nature of the class makes it invaluable for students preparing to enter the job market as skilled leaders. Faculty Coordinator 0 of 1 bios displayed David L.
