Degree Overview\nHarvard Law School Graduate Program\n5005 Wasserstein Hall (WCC)\n1585 Massachusetts Avenue\nCambridge, MA 02138\nContact Us\nThe philosophy of the LL.M. program is to offer our students a broad platform to design their own course of study within parameters set by the Harvard Law School faculty. Those parameters include some exposure to U.S. law, some writing experience, and, in the case of students who hold a J.D. degree from a school in the U.S. or Puerto Rico, a recommended exposure to legal theory.  See\nDegree Requirements\n. Within this framework, LL.M. students have enormous latitude in planning their year. Interested faculty, the Graduate Program staff, and special student advisors work hard throughout the year to help students identify and refine their study objectives, then develop an appropriate sequence of courses and other work.\nMost of a student’s program will be drawn from the regular\nHarvard Law School curriculum\n— some 500 courses and seminars each year, available to both J.D. and graduate students. Students also have the opportunity to pursue a limited number of credits at other faculties within Harvard and other area schools and a variety of writing projects. About half of the LL.M. students each year write an extensive research paper of approximately 50 pages on a topic the student develops in consultation with his or her faculty supervisor. Other students write shorter papers of some 25 pages in length, whether independently or in conjunction with a course or seminar.\nThe flexibility of the program enables students to take a varied curriculum, with courses ranging from environmental law to corporations to public international law and beyond, or to select courses primarily in a single area, such as constitutional law, business organization and finance, legal theory, or human rights.\nFinally, our students participate in a variety of extracurricular and co-curricular offerings on a not-for-credit basis. Graduate students participate in the full range of student organizations at the Law School. The Graduate Program and the Law School offer a multitude of other opportunities as well. For example, the Graduate Program features a series of information sessions highlighting various aspects of law teaching — an interactive forum for students from the various Law School degree programs — known as the\nLaw Teaching Colloquium\n.\nModal Gallery\nClose modal gallery\nof\nPrevious\nNext\nGallery Block Modal Gallery\nClose modal gallery\nof\nPrevious\nNext",

More than half of these courses have fewer than 25 students enrolled, including more than 75 seminars in which small groups of students work closely with faculty. Teaching and mentoring take place side by side, as faculty and students learn together and collaborate on projects that will change their communities and the world. Course Catalog Areas of Interest What makes our curriculum unique Clinical Programs Available to every student is our clinical program, in which students can develop real-world experience by practicing in one of the School’s 23 in-house clinics or any number of outside organizations. Writing at HLS Students also may engage in writing projects for academic credit, supervised by faculty at the top of their fields. International Opportunities Academic work of all kinds incorporates the world’s broadest and deepest set of opportunities in international, foreign and comparative law studies. Academic, Clinical, and Research Advising HLS students can meet with faculty members, clinical practitioners, and research librarians for guidance, advising, and mentorship.

Degree Requirements 5005 Wasserstein Hall (WCC) 1585 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA0 2138 Contact Us The philosophy of the LL.M. program is to offer our students a broad platform on which to design their own course of study within parameters set by the Harvard Law School faculty. All students must satisfactorily complete a minimum of 23 credits and a maximum of 28 credits in one academic year; most students complete between 23 and 25 credits. The foregoing minimum and maximum include the one credit assigned for completion of the portion of the Legal Research, Writing and Analysis course that takes place during Orientation.

Students also must satisfy some specific course and written work requirements. Specific Requirements International LL.M. students are free to choose their own courses. The only course requirement is that students must take one core course in U.S. law. The following courses have been pre-approved for this requirement: Antitrust Law, Contracts, Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law: First Amendment, Constitutional Law: Separation of Powers, Federalism, and Fourteenth Amendment, Corporations, Criminal Law, Evidence, Family Law, Legislation and Regulation, Property, Taxation, or Torts. International students also must write a paper of 25 or more pages that involves independent reflection, formulation of a sustained argument and, in many cases, outside research. Papers may be written either independently or in conjunction with a seminar. Finally, we strongly encourage students to take at least one course focusing on legal history, legal theory, policy analysis or legal process. For students who hold a J.D. from a law school in the United States or Puerto Rico , and who are hoping to embark on a law teaching career, the emphasis is slightly different. These students have the opportunity to take a step back and relate the doctrinal areas in which they previously concentrated to broader intellectual, social, and cultural traditions and to pursue an extended writing project. Thus, students from the United States and Puerto Rico are strongly encouraged to take at least one course that is primarily focused on legal theory or jurisprudence and are required to write a paper of at least 50 pages in length.
