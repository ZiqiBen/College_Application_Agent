No uniform course of study is prescribed for LL.M. candidates. Courses are elective, and students are afforded considerable flexibility to tailor their studies to their interests. Subject to meeting degree requirements, LL.M. candidates are invited to use the resources of the Law School in whatever program of study will best prepare them for a career in research and teaching.
