Compare programs here Doctoral Program of Study Brooks School PhD Students, Chloe Smith and Jillian Royal, attending the 2023 Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management conference. Each Public Policy PhD student completes a course of study designed to produce cutting-edge social science research on policy-relevant topics. Students gain expertise in: One or more areas of substantive public policy Cutting-edge empirical methods for policy research A social science discipline (Economics, Sociology, or another social science discipline by petition) The special committee is responsible for developing an appropriate course of study with each student. This individualized approach allows students to tailor their academic pursuits to meet their intellectual and professional goals. The program also provides ample opportunities for professional development and support throughout a student’s course of study. Coursework Public Policy PhD students typically spend their first two years immersed in disciplinary coursework, with an emphasis on foundational theory and methods. Common 1st year course sequences include: Theoretical Economics* (Micro Theory I & II, Econometrics I & II) Applied Economics (Microeconomics for Policy Analysis, Applied Econometrics I & II) Sociology (Social Theory I & II, Statistics for Social Research I & II) Other disciplinary tracks are also accepted by petition. *Math pre-reqs include: multivariate calculus, linear algebra, real analysis In the 2nd year, students turn to substantive policy courses in topics such as: labor,",

They also take additional methods courses in areas such as applied econometrics, demography, spatial analysis, computational methods, and qualitative and mixed-methods. 2nd Year Paper In their 2nd year, Public Policy PhD students also begin work on their 2nd year paper under the supervision of their special committee chair. This is an empirical paper with sufficient promise and contribution that it could potentially be publishable in a peer-reviewed academic journal. As such, this paper is structured like a journal article. It can be co-authored with faculty, but should be led by the student. Students begin writing the paper in the Spring of their second year (or earlier), and it is due to their special committee chair on December 15th of their third year. The committee chair is responsible for overseeing and approving the second year paper. The 2nd year paper form must be submitted to the GFA upon approval by the special committee chair. A and B Exams The Graduate School requires two examinations: a comprehensive Admission to Candidacy (“A” exam), taken after the student has earned at least two units of residence credit; and a final examination (“B” exam), given after completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Special Committee conducts these examinations. Student’s select a Special Committee chair and additional faculty members to create a Special Committee. The Special Committee is responsible, in concert, with the student, to map out a research and academic program. The Graduate School imposes no requirements for courses or grades; your Special Committee will ensure you make appropriate progress and achievement. To choose a Special Committee, the student must submit a request online from the “Advisor” section of the Student Center.

To choose a Special Committee, the student must submit a request online from the “Advisor” section of the Student Center. The Graduate School requires that students select a Special Committee by the end of their third semester of study . The A exam typically involves completing and orally defending a dissertation proposal and must be completed by the beginning of their 4th year. The requirement and structures of the A exam are coordinated with the student and the Special Committee Chair. It may involve a written dissertation proposal, a set of powerpoint slides, and an oral presentation of the proposed research followed by questions from the Special Committee. Students are encouraged to meet with their Special Committee Chair periodically throughout the 3 rd year of study to develop their research ideas and prepare for the A exam. The A exam must be scheduled with the Graduate School a calendar week before the exam. The exam must be scheduled using the Schedule A Examination and Research Compliance Form (online). The student must also make sure that the results of the exam are recorded on the Results for Admission to Candidacy (A Exam) (online) at least three business days after the exam. Both forms can be found here, Graduate Forms . The Special Committee passes the A exam if the student has provided sufficient evidence that their proposed dissertation research will meet the standards necessary to obtain a PhD in their field once completed. The Special Committee may pass the A exam outright; they may also conditionally pass the A exam, subject to certain revisions specified by the committee at the end of the exam. The student and committee members must agree to those revisions and a timeline for submitting the revision. The B exam entails a successful oral defense of the dissertation. Most students complete their B exam at the end of their 5th or 6th year, and should take place no later than the end of the 7th year. (Keep in mind",

Concentrations leverage the competitive research and teaching strengths of the Brooks School, as well as build on strong core foundational training. Brooks MPA students begin developing their specializations through a Gateway Course —these field seminars provide students with the state of art and science in a concentration and create a cohort of peers with similar interests. Concentrations available through the Brooks MPA Degree include the following: Data Science Economic Policy Environmental and Sustainability Policy International Policy and Management Public and Nonprofit Management Science and Technology Policy Social Policy: Health, Education, and Inequality Each concentration is designed to provide you with specialized knowledge and skills to advance your career in your chosen field. Policy Communication The Brooks MPA Degree hones policy communication skills . While decision analytics are an important part of successful public affairs practice, equally important is the ability to present analytics in clear, concise, and consumable ways; the Brooks MPA Degree hones verbal and written communication through intensive training in data visualization, effective policy communication, and presentation skills. Effective Policy Writing Public and Nonprofit Marketing Tools for Public Administration Following core foundational training, Brooks MPA students further develop their professional skills through tools courses, including: Accounting and Financial Management Strategic Negotiations Strategic Planning Professional Writing and Analysis Proficiency in analysis and written communication is crucial in the public affairs profession.

Thesis: Writing a master’s thesis is an option for those considering a PhD or who have a specific research interest within public affairs. This involves broad yet focused research. For additional information on writing a research thesis and format, see the Thesis and Dissertation Guide on the Cornell Graduate School website. Colloquium Coursework Career Management for Public Affairs The MPA Program Colloquium comprises a series of courses to equip students with the skills needed for the public affairs sector and familiarize them with current perspectives in the field. These courses are crucial for a thorough understanding of public affairs and for a smooth transition into professional roles. During the fall of their first year, students take this course to explore the public affairs career landscape and to acquire essential career management tools, including effective resume and cover letter writing, interviewing techniques, online reputation management, and self-assessment strategies. Professional Development for Public Affairs Both first- and second-year MPA students participate in this course each spring. The seminar series is case-based and interactive, encouraging students to explore how public affairs challenges are addressed across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. Students collaborate with peers to identify alternative decision options and develop potential resolutions. Practical Experience The Brooks MPA Degree is founded on applied learning—as much as possible, we want students to immediately apply what they learn in the classroom to solving management and policy problems through externships, internships, micro-credential programs, policy clinics, and our Capstone Program.

Okolo, Ph.D., is a Fellow at The Brookings Institution and a recent Computer Science Ph.D. graduate from Cornell University. Her research focuses on AI governance for the Global Majority, datafication and algorithmic marginalization, and the socioeconomic impact of data work. Dr. Okolo has been recognized as one of the world’s most influential people in AI by TIME, honored in the inaugural Forbes 30 Under 30 AI list, and advises numerous multilateral institutions, national governments, corporations, and nonprofits. Kayla : What drew you to pursue research in technology innovation and AI ethics? Did you always see yourself in this field? Chinasa T. Okolo : When it came to the AI ethics side of things, I was really interested in understanding how communities in the global South perceive and also interact with AI. That’s",

Kayla : What drew you to pursue research in technology innovation and AI ethics? Did you always see yourself in this field? Chinasa T. Okolo : When it came to the AI ethics side of things, I was really interested in understanding how communities in the global South perceive and also interact with AI. That’s what really drove my dissertation research, where I worked with community health care workers in rural India to understand how they perceive and value AI, and then also how methodologies like AI explainability could be tailored to make AI more accessible to them. When we think about technology innovation in general, and even AI ethics, a lot of this work is tailored towards Western contexts, and it leaves out a significant part of the world’s population who are actively leveraging these technologies. It may not necessarily be at the same scale, but there’s a lot that’s happening that can be very useful in understanding rural contexts in the US and other wealthier nations. When it comes to seeing myself in this field, I would say, yes because I was fortunate to attend Pomona College, a liberal arts college, for undergrad. For me, being exposed to students with so many different backgrounds and being able to take classes that were primarily not STEM informed my approach to really understanding AI and also technology. [This experience] also helped me understand that my voice was important in this field and that I would be able to contribute and grow as a researcher. Kayla : Is there any experience that particularly resonated with you while doing your field work? Chinasa T. Okolo : The work I did in India was really important because at the time, the community healthcare workers were already overburdened. There’s a lot of research that shows this was happening, within India and also throughout the rest of the global majority. Because the COVID-19 pandemic happened, they had extra duties added on to their work and they were underpaid. They were also some of the only healthcare professionals that many people in their respective communities would have access to. I’m just",

I’m just really grateful I had the opportunity to get firsthand experience because it’s very rare for computer scientists to do field work. It really shaped how I think about AI development as well as the harms and risks of trying to impose AI on these vulnerable communities. Kayla : Why would you say development and adoption of AI in the Global South is so important and why do you think it’s so overlooked by the global majority? Chinasa T. Okolo : When it comes to understanding development adoption, I think it’s important to understand that AI and technologies in general work very differently in these low resource contexts, particularly, in the global majority. This also impacts how these [AI] technologies are negatively impacting these populations. Due to the introduction of tools like Chatgpt, we’ve seen a very wide interest; organizations, companies, institutions and even governments around the world are trying to understand how they want to adopt AI. But the thing is, we know that a lot of these tools which are being promoted as being able to solve problems, whether they be for healthcare, education or agriculture, just don’t work. When we think about things like facial recognition, we see a very high emphasis of bias within these respective technologies. In the global South, or the global majority, in particular, we know that these populations are more likely to be marginalized by these respective technologies. Unfortunately, we don’t see equitable participation from countries in this region in developing technologies. However, when we do see this development happen, we see [AI] actually being able to address problems with more specificity and more efficiency, in ways that actually meet the needs of these local communities. This is something that I like to encourage in my work, to ensure that the development of",

This is something that I like to encourage in my work, to ensure that the development of AI is being led and driven by those that are local to these respective contexts. In general, I think that the development adoption itself is often overlooked because when we think about the global majority, a lot of companies don’t necessarily see consumers in these regions as being financially important to their respective bottom lines. We know that consumers in Africa, for example, have much less buying power than those in Northern America and in Europe. This is a big factor in why we see these AI technologies, and other technologies in general, not serving [Global South] communities. We’ve also seen neo-colonial links or existing colonial ties happen where a lot of resources, particularly labor and natural resources such as minerals, are extracted from these regions. Resource extraction also impedes the ability of global majority countries to actively participate in and engage in AI development and adoption. Kayla : What do you think responsible AI development looks like? How do you think we can overcome biases stemming from datafication and algorithmic marginalization? Chinasa T. Okolo : I think responsible AI development [means] considering how and where you should apply AI. Currently, we have this “AI hype” that’s overtaking many industries; there are so many people essentially selling snake oil. There’s a book actually called AI Snake Oil that came out recently which is really important in distilling some of these issues. This is something that all governments have to be aware of. We see people trying to apply AI [in contexts where] it should not be applied to or where we know that AI technologies are unlikely to work, particularly in things like emotion recognition and facial recognition. Some of these domains are built on pseudoscience, and so it’s hard to automate or even try to develop tools because the",

Some of these domains are built on pseudoscience, and so it’s hard to automate or even try to develop tools because the underlying science itself is so bad. That’s what I think responsible development should be part of. Tools concerning IQ estimation, emotion recognition, even trying to recognize someone’s gender or sexual identity- it’s very hard to do that even as a human yourself and so I think it becomes even more so harder for AI systems to do that. When it comes to the ethical side of it, it’s really about considering how you engage communities and ensure that there is equitable representation in the actual design and development process of the AI models and systems themselves. On the deployment side of things, I think that we don’t necessarily see a lot of consumer or end user participation, aside from them being subject to these AI technologies. Understanding the risks and dimensions of harm that happen when you actually implement AI technologies for real-world use cases- that’s what the ethical part of this is for me. When it comes to overcoming these biases, I think there are so many things that can happen. Unfortunately, when we think about the technical measures, it’s honestly a little bit hard because you can increase the diversity, quote unquote, of your respective data sets, [however], bias can also be encoded in the AI model architecture itself. It is not really clear how this happens. I did some work in AI explainability and also interpretability; even with these methods, it’s so hard to unpack how AI models themselves function. Developers have to be very intentional in how they design these systems, along with ensuring participation and diversity in their respective data sets. I think that when it comes to datification and algorithmic marginalization, a lot of it happens because companies are driven without regard for consumer rights.

If there aren’t governance frameworks that can provide guardrails or limitations for their respective work, this is very likely to happen. I think that a big part of overcoming these biases and the harm that is enacted on vulnerable populations, as well as everyone who is subject to AI systems, is having governance frameworks in place to provide recourse from algorithmic harms as well as ways to help companies guide AI development responsibly. Kayla: Lastly, do you have any book recommendations for people interested in AI ethics and global development? Chinasa T. Okolo : Definitely. I read a really interesting book, Code-Dependent: Living in the Shadow of AI by Madhumita Murgia, at the end of last year, which talked about AI impacting various aspects of society. [The book] was very interesting because it got into some topics that I find a lot of other books don’t go into, particularly when we think about the labor that impacts AI systems; a lot of these workers are based in eastern Africa and also throughout Southeast Asia and Latin America. There’s another book I would recommend: The New Empire of AI by Rachel Adams. I have had the chance to interact with Rachel a bit, and her work is really interesting; she founded and leads the Global Center for AI Governance based in South Africa. She’s been able to do a lot of empirical work to understand how governments across the world are advancing responsible AI. This work is through the African Observatory for AI, and then they also formed a Global Index on Responsible AI. Her book discusses issues of AI and global inequality which I think is really great, especially when we consider the global side of AI because there are so many books that don’t talk about biases and are very Western-centric.

Her book is very relevant to what we see going on in government right now and how the US government’s actions impact the rest of the world. Interview ==== COURSE DETAIL END (Interview) ====",
